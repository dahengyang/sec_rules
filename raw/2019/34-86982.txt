SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<END HEADER>

<h>I. Background</h>

On June 28, 2018, the Commission published a final rule amending its FOIA regulations at <sup>17</sup> CFR 200.80 (Securities and Exchange Commission records and information). Because of the breadth of the amendments, the final rule removed the Commission’s prior FOIA regulations in their entirety (§ 200.80 and appendices A through F) and replaced them with new regulations (§ 200.80).

In light of the <sup>2018</sup> amendments of its FOIA regulations, the Commission is now adopting technical amendments to other sections of title 17, chapter II of the Code of Federal

Regulations to update cross-references to the Commission’s FOIA regulations (§ 200.80) that are contained in those sections.

<h>II. Administrative Law Matte rs</h>

The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) generally requires an agency to publish notice of a rulemaking in the Federal Register and provide an opportunity for public comment. This requirement does not apply, however, if the agency “for good cause finds . . . that notice and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” <sup>1</sup> The technical amendments do not impose any new substantive regulatory requirements on any person. The technical amendments merely update cross-references in the Commission’sregulations. These amendments are therefore ministerial in nature. For these reasons, there isgood cause for the Commission to find that it is unnecessary to publish notice of these amendments in the Federal Register or to solicit public comment thereon. <sup>2</sup> Although the APA generally requires publication of a rule at least <sup>30</sup> days before its effective date, for similar reasons we further find there is good cause for the amendments to take effect on September 26, 2019. Additionally, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which apply only when notice and comment are required by the APA or other law, are not applicable. <sup>3</sup> These amendments do not contain any collection of information requirements as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. <sup>4</sup>

Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act, <sup>5</sup> the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has designated this final rule as not a “major rule,” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

<h>III. Economic Analysis</h>

We are adopting technical amendments to update cross-references to Commission rulesin light of recent amendments to the Commission’s FOIA regulations. These amendments merely make conforming changes to Commission rules that cross-reference the FOIA regulations and do not impose any substantive regulatory obligations on any person or otherwise. We expect the amendments to help eliminate potential confusion that could result from outdated cross-references. We do not believe they will have any substantial economic effects, including onefficiency, competition, or capital formation. Further, because the amendments impose no new burdens on private parties, the Commission does not believe that the amendments will have any impact on competition for purposes of section 23(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). <sup>6</sup>
