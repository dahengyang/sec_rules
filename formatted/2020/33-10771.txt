Securities Offering Reform for Closed-End Inve stment Companie s AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION: Final rule.

SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) is adopting rules that will modify the registration, communications, and offering processes for business development companies (“BDCs”) and other closed-end investment companies under the Securities Act of 1933. As directed by Congress, we are adopting rules that will allow these investment companies to use the securities offering rules that are already available to operating companies. These rules will extend to closed-end investment companies offering reforms currently available to operating company issuers by expanding the definition of “well-known seasoned issuer” to allow these investment companies to qualify; streamlining the registration process for these investment companies, including the process for shelf registration; permitting these investment companies to satisfy their final prospectus delivery requirements by filing the prospectus with the Commission; and permitting additional communications by and about these investment companies during a registered public offering. In addition, we are amending certain rules and forms to tailor the disclosure and regulatory framework to these

investment companies. These amendments also will modernize our approach to securities registration fee payment by requiring closed-end investment companies that operate as “interval funds” to pay securities registration fees using the same method as mutual funds

and exchange-traded funds and extend the ability to use this payment method to issuers of certain continuously offered, exchange-traded products (“ETPs”). Additionally, we are expanding the ability of certain registered closed-end funds or BDCs that conduct continuous offerings to make changes to their registration statements on an immediately

effective basis or on an automatically effective basis a set period of time after filing. Lastly, we are adopting certain structured data reporting requirements, including for filings on the form providing annual notice of securities sold pursuant to the rule under the Investment Company Act of <sup>1940</sup> that prescribes the method by which certain investment companies (including mutual funds) calculate and pay registration fees.

DATES: Effective Dates: This rule is effective August 1, 2020, except for amendatory instructions 21, 22, 30, 31, 33, 34, 41, 42, and 45 which are effective August 1, 2021.

Compliance Dates : The applicable compliance dates are discussed below in

section II.J .

<h>I. INTRODUCTION</h>

We are adopting rules that will modify the registration, communications, and offering processes for business development companies (“BDCs”) and registered closed- end investment companies (“registered CEFs”), including interval funds (collectively,“affected funds”) under the Securities Act. <sup>4</sup> In 2005, the Commission adopted securities offering reforms for operating companies to modernize the securities offering and communication processes while maintaining the protection of investors under the

Securities A c t. <sup>5</sup> At that time, the Commission specifically excluded all investment companies—including affected funds—from the scope of the reforms. <sup>6</sup> Now, as directed by Congress, we are adopting rules that will allow affected funds to use the securities offering rules that are already available to operating companies.“Interval funds” are a type of registered CEF or BDC that make periodic repurchaseoffers pursuant to rule 23c-3 under the Investment Company Act. See 17 CFR 270.23c-3 (“rule 23c-3”).

The Small Business Credit Availability Act (the “BDC Act”) directs us to allow a BDC to use the securities offering rules that are available to other issuers required to file reports under section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Exchange Ac t . <sup>7</sup> As discussed in detail below, the BDC Act identifies with specificity the required revisions. <sup>8</sup> The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Registered CEF Act”) (and, together with the BDC Act, the “Acts”) directs us to adopt rules to allow anyregistered CEF that is listed on a national securities exchange (a “listed registered CEF”) or that makes periodic repurchase offers under rule 23c-3 to use the securities offering rules that are available to other issuers that are required to file reports under section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, subject to appropriate conditions. <sup>9</sup> Unlike the BDC Act, the Registered CEF Act does not identify with specificity the revisions that are required.

In 2019, we proposed rules that would modify the registration, communications, and offering processes for affected funds under the Securities A c t. <sup>10</sup> As discussed ingreater detail below, most commenters supported the proposal. <sup>11</sup> Many of the commenters who supported the proposal generally also recommended modifications to some of the proposed rules. <sup>12</sup> For example, some commenters recommended further expanding the scope of issuers that would qualify as “well-known seasoned issuers” to include smaller issuers or those without public float. <sup>13</sup> Commenters also recommended eliminating or modifying the proposed requirement that certain additional affected funds file current reports on Form 8-K. <sup>14</sup> Other commenters recommended that the Commission expand the scope of issuers permitted to file certain immediately effective registration statements. <sup>15</sup> Several commenters that are sponsors to exchange-traded productsrecommended that the Commission expand the scope of issuers permitted to pay registration fees on an annual net basis. <sup>16</sup> Finally, one commenter expressed concern with the proposal, recommending that large BDCs and registered CEFs be subject toadditional scrutiny. <sup>17</sup> As discussed in detail below, we are adopting the proposed rules with certain modifications, after consideration of comments received.

Our action will institute a number of reforms:

First, it will streamline the registration process to allow eligible affected funds to use a short-form shelf registration statement to sell securities “off the shelf” more quickly and efficiently in response to market opportunities.

Second, the final rule will allow affected funds to qualify as “well-known seasoned issuers” (“WKSIs”) under rule <sup>405</sup> under the Securities Act.

Third, it will allow affected funds to satisfy final prospectus delivery requirements using the same method as operating companies.

Fourth, it will allow affected funds to use certain rules currently available to operating companies, such as communications safe harbors for certain factual business information and forward-looking information, “free writingprospectuses,” and broker-dealer research reports (referred throughout this release as the “communications rules”).

Fifth, the final rule will allow certain continuously-offered affected funds to make certain changes to their registration statements on an immediately-effective basis or on an automatically effective basis a set period of time after filing.

Finally, it will tailor the disclosure and regulatory framework for affected funds in light of the amendments to the offering rules applicable to them. These amendments include structured data requirements to make it easier for investors and others to analyze fund data; new annual report disclosure requirements toprovide key information in annual reports; a requirement that interval funds pay securities registration fees using the same method that mutual funds andexchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) use today; and a provision that will allow certain ETPs that are not registered under the Investment Company Act to elect to paysecurities registration fees in the same manner.

As discussed in detail below, the final rule will affect different categories of affected funds differently, just as different categories of operating companies are treated differently under these rules currently. For example, some of the provisions will apply to all affected funds, that is, all BDCs and registered CEFs. Many of the provisions, however, will apply only to “seasoned funds.” These are listed affected funds that are current and timely in their reporting and therefore generally eligible to file a short-form registration statement under the proposal if they have at least $75 million in “public float. ” <sup>18</sup> Some of the provisions will apply only to seasoned funds that also qualify as WKSIs, that is, listed affected funds that qualify as seasoned funds and generally have at least $700 million in public float . <sup>19</sup> Additiona lly, the final rule provides unlisted affected funds with the flexibility to make certain filings that become effective either immediately

I.B.1 of Form S-3. Certain issuers with less than $75 million in public float also are eligible to use Form S-3 to register a primary offering but are limited as to the amount of securities they can register. See General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3. The Commission has stated that the calculations of an issuer’s public float for the purpose of determining an issuer’s eligibility to use Form S-3 and for determining WKSI status under rule 405 are the same. See Securities Offering Reform Adopting Release, supra footnote 5, at n.50.upon filing or automatically after <sup>60</sup> days. <sup>20</sup> The final rule therefore will provide additional flexibilities to both listed and unlisted affected funds. Tables 1 and 2 below summarize these different impacts.

TABLE 1

Notes:1. Some of the rule changes that are shown below as affecting “seasoned funds” will only affect those seasoned funds that elect to file a registration statement on Form N-2 using an instruction permitting funds to use the form to file a short-form registration statement.

Structured Data Reporting Requirements

<h>II. DISCUSSION</h>

<h>A. Scope of Closed-End Inve stme nt Companie s Affected by the Final Rule</h>

As we proposed, the final rule will apply to all BDCs and registered CEFs, with certain conditions and exceptions discussed below and generally illustrated in Tables 1 and 2 above. The BDC Act applies to all BDCs, including BDCs that are listed on a securities exchange and those that are unlisted. <sup>21</sup> In contrast, the Registered CEF Act extends to all registered CEFs listed on a securities exchange, as well as interval funds, but excludes other unlisted registered CEFs. <sup>22</sup>

Although the Registered CEF Act only requires us to allow interval funds and listed registered CEFs to use the securities offering rules available to operating companies, that Act does not preclude us from exercising our discretion to extend these rules to all registered CEFs. The Commission therefore proposed to apply the rules to all BDCs and all registered CEFs, including unlisted registered CEFs, with certain conditions and exceptions. <sup>23</sup> We believed that this approach would benefit unlisted registered CEFs and their investors by avoiding the adverse consequences that could result from treating unlisted registered CEFs differently from all other registered CEFs and unlisted BDCs.

We believed that applying such a distinction is unnecessary because, for purposes of these rules, unlisted registered CEFs are not distinguishable from unlisted BDCs, which the rule amendments must cover. Unlisted registered CEFs, like unlisted BDCs, also would benefit from parity of treatment. <sup>24</sup> We did not receive comment on this aspect of the proposal. Because we continue to believe that this approach will benefit unlisted registered CEFs and their investors by providing new investor protections and avoidingadverse consequences from differential treatment, the final rule will apply to all BDCs and registered CEFs as proposed.

The Commission proposed to generally apply the specific requirements of the BDC Act to both BDCs and registered CEFs because it believed that, except where dictated by meaningful differences between BDCs and registered CEFs, consistent application of the proposed rules across affected funds would result in more efficient offering processes and more consistent investor protections. <sup>25</sup> We continue to believe that both Acts share the overall purpose of providing offering and communication rule parity to the investment companies covered by each Act. <sup>26</sup> We did not receive public comment on this aspect of the proposal, and, for the reasons stated above, we are adopting it as proposed.

<h>B. Registration Proce ss</h>

We are adopting, substantially as proposed, amendments to our rules and forms to streamline the registration process for affected funds by permitting them to use the moreflexible registration process available to operating companies. These amendments collectively will allow affected funds to offer and sell securities “off the shelf” more quickly and efficiently in response to market opportunities.

<h>1. Current Shelf Offering Process for Affected Funds</h>

Issuers, including affected funds, whose offerings are registered or qualified to be registered on Form S-3 may conduct primary offerings “off the shelf” under Securities Act rule 415(a)(1)(x), the provision for offerings made on a delayed or continuousbasis. <sup>27</sup> In a rule 415(a)(1)(x) shelf offering, a seasoned issuer can register an unallocated dollar amount of securities for sale at a later tim e . <sup>28</sup> The issuer can then take down securities “off the shelf” for sale in a public offering as market conditions warrant. This allows seasoned issuers to quickly access the public securities markets from time to time to take advantage of favorable market conditions. <sup>29</sup>

Affected funds currently can make shelf offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(x) if they meet the eligibility criteria for Form S-3, even though affected funds register their securities offerings on Form N-2. <sup>30</sup> Our rules for operating companies, however, are more flexible and efficient than for affected funds. In particular, seasoned operatingn.18 (explaining the requirements under General Instruction I.A. of Form S-3).companies can use a short-form registration statement on Form S-3. Certain seasoned operating companies also can rely on Securities Act rule 430B to omit certain information from the “base” prospectus when the registration statement becomes effective and later provide that information in a subsequent Exchange Act report incorporated by reference, a prospectus supplement, or a post-effective amendment. <sup>31</sup> The ability to “forward incorporate” information in Exchange Act reports filed after theregistration statement becomes effective allows operating companies to efficiently update their prospectuses and access capital markets without the expense and delay of filingpost-effective amendments in most cases.

Affected funds, on the other hand, currently have limited ability to incorporate information by reference into their registration statements and cannot forward incorporate information from subsequently-filed Exchange Act reports. <sup>32</sup> When an affected fund sells securities, including as part of a takedown “off the shelf,” its registration statement must include all required information. <sup>33</sup> In particular, the affected fund’s registration statement must include current financial information, including any annual update required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act. <sup>34</sup> Affected funds provide any section 10(a)(3) update to the registration statement by filing a post-effective amendment, which involves the expense and potential delay associated with the fund’s preparation of the amendmentand also provides our staff with time to review the amendment for compliance with the applicable disclosure and accounting requirements and to provide comments where appropriate. <sup>35</sup>

Affected funds also cannot currently rely on rule 430B, which allows certain issuers to omit information from a prospectus, or the process that operating companies follow to file prospectus supplements. <sup>36</sup> In addition, affected funds cannot currently file automatic shelf registration statements because only WKSIs can file these registration statements. These differences can result in additional expense or delay for affected funds relative to operating companies and can affect the timing of an affected fund’s capital raising . <sup>37</sup>

<h>2. Amendments to the Registration Process for Affected Funds</h>

The amendments we are adopting are designed to streamline the registration process for affected funds in parity with operating companies. Specifically, and as discussed in more detail below, the amendments will permit affected funds to:

File a short-form registration statement on Form N-2 that will function like a Form S-3 registration statement. An affected fund that files this short-form registration statement can use it to register shelf offerings, including shelf registration statements that are filed by affected funds that qualify as WKSIs and become effective automatically, and can satisfy Form N-2’s disclosure requirements by incorporating by reference information from the fund’s Exchange Act reports;

Rely on rule 430B to omit information from their base prospectuses, and to use the process operating companies follow to file prospectus supplements; and

Include additional information in periodic reports to update their registration statements.

Commenters generally supported our general approach to streamlining the registration process for affected funds. Commenters stated that the proposed amendments would allow affected funds to raise capital more efficiently and cost-effectively and would provide affected funds with greater flexibility to manage the timing of their offerings in response to market opportunities. <sup>38</sup> One commenter stated that affected funds will benefit from the proposed amendments because they no longer will have to file post- effective amendments to shelf registration statements to update their financial statements. Instead, that information will be in annual reports and incorporated by reference into their registration statements. <sup>39</sup>

<h>3. Short-Form Registration on Form N-2</h>

We are adopting, as proposed, new General Instruction A.2 in Form N-2, which will allow affected funds to file a short-form registration statement on Form N-2 that will function like a registration statement filed on Form S-3. <sup>40</sup> If a fund files a registration statement under this new instruction, the fund’s registration statement will incorporate certain past and future Exchange Act reports by reference, allowing the fund to use a short-form registration statement and avoid the need to make post-effective amendments in most cases. An affected fund may use the new instruction to register a shelf offering under rule 415(a)(1)(x), and we are adopting conforming amendments to that rule tomake this clear. <sup>41</sup> The new instruction, however, is not limited to offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(x). Rather, an affected fund may use the new instruction to register any of the securities offerings that operating companies are permitted to register on Form S-3. <sup>42</sup>

<h>a. Eligibility to File a Short-Form Registration Statement</h>

As proposed, we are adopting amendments to permit an affected fund to file a short-form registration statement under the short-form registration instruction on Form N- 2 if:for either a BDC or a registered CEF, the fund meets both the registrant requirements and the transaction requirements of Form S-3 ( i.e. , the fund could register the offering on Form S-3 if it were an operating company); <sup>43</sup> andfor registered CEFs only, the fund also has been registered under the Investment Company Act for at least <sup>12</sup> calendar months immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement and has timely filed all reports required to be filed under section 30 of the Investment Company Act during that time. <sup>44</sup>

An affected fund generally will meet the registrant requirements of Form S-3 if it has timely filed all reports and other materials required under the Exchange Act during the prior year. <sup>45</sup> An affected fund will generally meet the transaction requirements of Form S-3 for a primary offering if the fund’s public float is $75 million or more. <sup>46</sup> Requiring affected funds to satisfy the requirements of Form S-3 in order to file a short- form registration statement provides parity between affected funds and operatingcompanies, consistent with Congress’s mandates in the BDC Act and Registered CEF Act.

Commenters generally supported the proposal to permit affected funds to file short-form registration statements. <sup>47</sup> Several commenters, however, urged that we provide additional bases other than public float for an affected fund to be eligible to file a short-form registration statement (or to qualify as a WKSI). <sup>48</sup> While the arguments advanced by commenters apply to our proposed short-form registration requirement, commenters focused primarily on our proposed public float threshold for WKSI status. <sup>49</sup> Accordingly, we discuss these comments below in section II.C.2 . For the reasons discussed in that section, we are not changing the public float requirement or adopting new requirements for affected funds to file a short-form registration statement. We are adopting the proposed $75 million public float requirement for an affected fund to file a short-form registration statement on Form N-2 to provide affected funds parity with operating companies.

Certain affected funds, including most interval funds , <sup>50</sup> do not list their securities on an exchange and thus do not have public float. As a result, these affected funds generally would not be able to satisfy the transaction requirement necessary to file ashort-form registration statement . <sup>51</sup> In addition, as we noted in the Proposing Release, because interval funds make continuous offerings, they (as well as other continuously offered, non-listed affected funds) would not be able to file a short-form registration statement that omits information required to be in an issuer’s prospectus when it is offering its securities. <sup>52</sup>

Interval funds also have their own offering provision, Securities Act rule 415(a)(1)(xi), <sup>53</sup> and post-effective amendments to their registration statements are immediately effective upon filing or automatically effective 60 days after filing underrule <sup>486</sup> under the Securities Act, depending on the substance of the amendments. <sup>54</sup> As a result, interval funds currently have a tailored registration process that, although different in certain respects from that of operating companies, may provide many of the sameefficiencies, including the ability to raise capital as the opportunity arises. As discussed below in section II.D, we are adopting amendments to rule <sup>486</sup> to allow any affected fund that conducts continuous offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(ix), such as continuously-offered tender offer funds, to rely on rule 486. We believe these amendments will benefit suchcontinuously-offered affected funds by allowing them to maintain effective registration statements in a more efficient, cost-effective manner, similar to the benefits that the rules we are adopting will provide to affected funds that file short-form registration statements.

As proposed, in addition to satisfying the registrant requirements of Form S-3, a registered CEF also must have timely filed all reports required under section 30 of the Investment Company Act for the preceding 12 months in order to register an offering under the short-form registration instruction. A registered CEF therefore must have timely filed during the prior year all required Exchange Act reports, such as annual and semi-annual reports to shareholders filed with the Commission on Form N-CSR, as well as reports required only under section 30 of the Act, such as reports on Forms N-CEN and N-PORT.

As we stated in the Proposing Release, an issuer’s Exchange Act filings provide the basic source of information to the market and to potential purchasers, and investors in the secondary market use that information in making their investment decisions. <sup>55</sup> Although all affected funds file reports under the Exchange Act, registered CEFs also file reports under the Investment Company Act. These Investment Company Act reports also provide important information to the market and investors, including information about an affected fund’s portfolio holdings that will be publicly reported on a quarterly basis on Form N-PORT. We believe that the market will analyze this portfolio holdings information in a similar manner to how it analyzes financial statements for operating companies to determine changes in prospects for growth and performance. Portfolio holdings disclosure on Form N-PORT, for example, provides important information thatis comparable to information BDCs include in Exchange Act reports for purposes of providing a quarterly flow of key information to the market. Moreover, requiring registered CEFs to have timely filed their Investment Company Act reports also will provide parity among BDCs, registered CEFs, and operating companies. This is because once Form N-PORT fully replaces Form N-Q, registered CEFs will only file Exchange Act reports semi-annually on Form N-CSR, whereas BDCs and operating companies file Exchange Act reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. <sup>56</sup> As such, all issuers will be required to have filed their quarterly and other required reports in order to file a short- form registration statement.

We received one comment on this particular aspect of the proposal. This commenter expressed support for this aspect of the proposal, stating that it provides parity between registered CEFs and operating companies. <sup>57</sup>

<h>b. Information Incorporated by Reference</h>

As proposed, the same rules on incorporation by reference that apply to Form S-3 registration statements also will apply to a short-form registration statement filed on Form N-2 . <sup>58</sup> We did not receive comments on these amendments and are adopting themas proposed. Specifically, an affected fund relying on the short-form registration instruction will be required to:

Specifically incorporate by reference into the prospectus and statement of additional information (“SAI”): (1) its latest annual report filed pursuant to section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act that contains financialstatements for the registrant’s latest fiscal year for which a Form N-CSR or Form 10-K was required to be filed; and (2) all other reports filed pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act since the end of the fiscal year covered by the annual report (backward incorporation by reference); <sup>59</sup> and

State that all documents subsequently filed pursuant to section 13(a), 13(c), 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act prior to the termination of the offering shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the prospectus and SAI (forward incorporation by reference). <sup>60</sup>

We also are adopting, as proposed, an instruction to Form N-2 that will permit an affected fund filing a short-form registration statement on Form N-2 to satisfy the disclosure requirements for its prospectus or SAI by incorporating the information by

Form N-2). We are amending General Instruction F.3 of current Form N-2 in its entirety and replacing it with a new General Instruction F.3. In these provisions and others that are substantively identical to parallel provisions in Form S-3, we have included conforming references to a fund’s SAI.reference from Exchange Act reports. <sup>61</sup> This provision, which is substantively identical to a parallel item in Form S-3, will give affected funds filing a short-form registrationstatement on Form N-2 the option to either provide required disclosure directly in the prospectus or SAI or to satisfy Form N-2’s disclosure requirements with information incorporated by reference. <sup>62</sup> We did not receive any comments on these particular amendments to Form N-2.

We also are adopting, as proposed, conforming changes to Form N-2’s undertakings. <sup>63</sup> Form N-2 currently requires an undertaking that would prevent seasoned funds that file a short-form shelf registration statement from incorporating information by reference as proposed, because it requires funds to file post-effective amendments in

Commenters suggested that the Item 34.1 undertaking to suspend an offering if a fund’s NAV declines more than 10% from its NAV on its registration statement effective date until the fund amends the prospectus should not apply to continuous or delayed shelf offerings conducted by affected funds pursuant to proposed General Instruction A.2 of Form N-2. See Comment Letter of Dechert LLP (June 10, 2019) (“Dechert Comment Letter”); IPA Comment Letter; see also Item 34.1 of current Form N-2. Commenters urged that the undertaking should not apply in these circumstances because the shelf offering could extend over 3-1/2 years, and the undertaking did not seem necessary because the fund would amend its prospectus by incorporating by reference the information from its Exchange Act reports. See Dechert Comment Letter; IPA comment Letter . We agree, and are amending Item 34.1 to clarify that this undertaking is not applicable in the circumstance described by commenters. See Item 34.1 of amended Form N-2.certain circumstances without providing an exception that would allow the required information to be supplied via incorporation by reference. <sup>64</sup> In contrast, operating companies registering an offering on Form S-3 are not required under the applicable undertaking to file post-effective amendments if the required information is included in an Exchange Act report incorporated by reference or a prospectus supplement that is part of the registration statement. <sup>65</sup> To implement the statutory mandates and provide parity for affected funds, we are adopting amendments to Form N-2’s undertakings to provide the same approach for affected funds filing a short-form registration statement on that form that applies to operating companies that file on Form S-3 . <sup>66</sup>

<h>a. of current Form N-2.</h>

We also are amending Item 34 to make conforming changes to mirror parallel undertakings in Item 512 of Regulation S-K. See, e.g ., Item 34.3.a(2) of amended Form N-2; cf . Item 512(a)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-K; Item 34.3.d(1) of amended Form N-2; cf . Item 512(a)(5)(i) of Regulation S-K; Item 34.3.e(2)-(3) of amended Form N-2; cf . Item 512(a)(6)(ii)–(iii) of Regulation S-K; Item 34.5 of amended Form N-2; cf . Item 512(b) of Regulation S-K; and Item 34.6 of amended Form N-2; cf . Item 512(h) of Regulation S-K.

Additionally, in response to comments, we are eliminating the undertaking in Item 34.3 of current Form N-2, which requires affected funds to undertake to supplement the prospectus or file a post-effective amendment to disclose certain information if the securities being registered are to be offered to existing shareholders, and if not taken, to be reoffered to the public. See Dechert Comment Letter; IPA Comment. The Commission recently eliminated a parallel undertaking from Regulation S-K because other requirements make the undertaking duplicative and unnecessary. See FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, Investment Company Act Release

The Proposing Release requested comment on whether we should modify incorporation by reference provisions in other registration forms filed by affected funds to provide parity or consistency across registration statements. In particular, we asked if we should amend Form N-14 to provide that BDCs may incorporate by reference to the same extent as registered CEFs. <sup>67</sup> Commenters supported this approach, <sup>68</sup> which would provide for more consistent treatment between registered CEFs and BDCs.

We are modifying Form N-14 to allow BDCs to incorporate by reference to the same extent as registered CEFs. As commenters observed, this change will provide consistent treatment for BDCs and registered CEFs. This change also will reduce the length of a BDC’s Form N-14 prospectus, which in some cases can exceed 1,000 pages, because BDCs cannot currently incorporate information by reference. To effectuate this change, we are amending the instruction in Form N-14 that governs incorporation byreference to specifically include BDCs and clarify that current reports include those filed pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. <sup>69</sup> Additionally, in response to

No. 33426 (Mar. 20, 2019) [84 FR 12674 (Apr. 2, 2019)] (“FAST Act Modernization

Adopting Release”), at n.171. We are eliminating this undertaking from Form N-2 for the same reasons, and renumbering Item 34’s sub-items accordingly.comments, <sup>70</sup> we are eliminating the requirement that registrants file with the Form N-14 registration statement the documents that contain information that is incorporated byreference into the prospectus or SAI. <sup>71</sup> Such documents are filed on EDGAR and readily available to Commission staff.

<h>c. Affected Funds’ Use of Rule 415(a)(1)(x) and Automatic Shelf Registration Statements</h>

We are adopting, as proposed, two additional amendments to allow affected funds to use the shelf registration system in parity with operating companies. First, we areamending rule 415(a)(1)(x) to clarify that affected funds may use that rule by addingreferences to a registration statement filed under the short-form registration instruction. <sup>73</sup>deliver copies of the documents containing such information with the prospectus. See , e.g. , Dechert Comment Letter. Because the delivery requirement applies to funds generally and not just affected funds, we believe that any changes to the requirement should be considered on a broader basis that is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.

Second, we are adopting a new general instruction to permit affected funds that qualify as WKSIs to file an automatic shelf registration statement. <sup>74</sup> A WKSI can register unspecified amounts of different types or classes of securities on an automatic shelf registration statement. <sup>75</sup> An automatic shelf registration statement and any amendments to the registration statement will be effective immediately upon filing. <sup>76</sup> Automatic shelf registration provides WKSIs with significant flexibility to take advantage of market windows, structure terms of securities on a real-time basis to accommodate investor demand, and determine or change the plan of distribution in response to changing market conditions. WKSIs using an automatic shelf registration statement further benefit by being able to pay filing fees at any time in advance of a shelf takedown or on a “pay-as- you-go” basis at the time of each takedown off the shelf registration statement in an amount calculated for that takedown. <sup>77</sup> Our amendments will extend these same benefitsregistration statement became effective. Cf. Securities Offering Reform Adopting Release, supra footnote <sup>5</sup> , at 44774–44775.to affected funds that qualify as WKSIs, as directed by the BDC Act and the Registered CEF Act . <sup>78</sup> We did not receive any comments on these particular amendments. <sup>79</sup>

<h>d. Omitting Information from a Base Prospectus and Prospectus Supplements</h>

The BDC Act directed us to include a process for a BDC to file a prospectus in the same manner as under rule 424(b). <sup>80</sup> Consistent with this directive and with the

Registered CEF Act, we are amending, as proposed, rule 424(f) to allow affected funds tofile a prospectus under rule 424. <sup>81</sup> As discussed in the Proposing Release, affected funds registering shelf offerings under Securities Act rule <sup>415</sup> generally can omit required information from the base prospectus that is unknown or not reasonably available to the fund when the registration statement becomes effective. <sup>82</sup> WKSIs and certain issuers eligible to use Form S-3 for primary offerings are permitted under rule 430B to omit certain additional information. A base prospectus that omits statutorily-require d information is not a final prospectus under section 10(a) of the Securities Ac t . <sup>83</sup> Filing aprospectus supplement pursuant to rule <sup>424</sup> is one way to provide information required for a prospectus to satisfy the requirements of section 10(a) . <sup>84</sup>

Our rules, however, provide different processes for operating companies and investment companies to file prospectuses. Operating companies currently follow rule <sup>424</sup> to file prospectus supplements, whereas investment companies follow rule 497.

Although these rules provide similar processes, they have certain key differences. For example, rule 424(b) is designed to work together with rule 415(a)(1)(x), and provides additional time for an issuer to file a prospectus. Rule <sup>497</sup> does not contain provisions specifically related to offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(x) and requires the fund to file a prospectus with the Commission before using it. Rule <sup>424</sup> also requires an issuer to file a prospectus when the issuer makes changes from or additions to a previously-file d prospectus that are substantive, whereas rule <sup>497</sup> requires funds to file every prospectus that varies from any previously-filed prospectus.

Under the amendment to rule 424(f), an affected fund will be able to file any type of prospectus enumerated in rule 424(b) to update, or to include information omitted from, a prospectus or in connection with a shelf takedown. <sup>85</sup> We also are amending rule <sup>497</sup> to provide that rule <sup>424</sup> would be the exclusive rule for affected funds to file aprospectus supplement other than an advertisement that is deemed to be a prospectus under 17 CFR 230.482 (rule 482). <sup>86</sup> This will avoid any confusion that might result if affected funds were permitted to file prospectuses under both rule <sup>424</sup> and rule 497,while also continuing to require affected funds to file rule <sup>482</sup> advertisements as they and other investment companies do today.

We also are adopting, as proposed, an amendment to permit affected funds to userule 430B in parity with operating companies. <sup>87</sup> We received no comments on this aspect of the proposal. Thus an affected fund may omit certain information from its prospectus in two circumstances:

A WKSI filing an automatic shelf registration statement may omit the plan of distribution and information as to whether the offering is a primary one or an offering on behalf of selling security holders.

If an issuer is eligible to file a registration statement on Form S-3 to register a primary offering pursuant to General Instruction I.B.1 of Form S-3, and is registering the resale of securities on behalf of selling security holders, it may omit the identities of selling security holders and the amount of securities to be registered on their behalf, subject to certain conditions. <sup>88</sup>34.3.d(1) of amended Form N-2; cf .

<h>e. Additional Information in Periodic Reports</h>

As discussed above, the amendments we are adopting will permit certain affected funds to forward incorporate information from their Exchange Act reports. These funds may wish to include information in their periodic reports that is not required to be included in these reports in order to update their registration statements. We therefore proposed to include a new instruction to Form N-2 that would allow a fund to include additional information so as long as the fund included a statement in the reportidentifying information that it included for this purpose to provide context for investors. <sup>89</sup>

After considering comments we received, we are not adopting this proposed instruction.

The commenters that addressed this proposed new instruction to Form N-2 recommended against requiring this identifying statement in periodic reports on the grounds that it unnecessarily emphasized information included to update the fund’s registration statement and could potentially distract investors from other information that may be more material to their investment decisions. <sup>90</sup> These commenters also stated that requiring funds to identify this information would not be consistent with an integrated disclosure regime in which the information is incorporated by reference. We have determined not to adopt the identification requirement. After considering comments, we158) specify when information contained in a prospectus supplement will be deemed part of and included in the registration statement and circumstances that will trigger a new effective date of the registration statement for purposes of section 11(a) of the Securities Act. These rules apply to affected funds just as they apply to operating companies.are persuaded that requiring an affected fund to highlight information just because it updates the fund’s registration statement could unnecessarily emphasize it.

<h>C. We ll-Known Se asone d Issuer Status</h>

We are adopting, as proposed, amendments that will allow certain affected funds to qualify as WKSIs. Issuers that qualify as WKSIs are permitted to receive the greatest degree of benefits from the modifications to the communications and registration rules that the Commission adopted in 2005. <sup>91</sup> A WKSI, for example, can file a registrationstatement or amendment that becomes effective automatically in a broader variety of contexts than a non-WKSI. In addition, subject to certain conditions, a WKSI may communicate at any time, including through a free writing prospectus, without violating the “gun-jumping” provisions of the Securities Act. <sup>92</sup>

To qualify as a WKSI, the issuer must meet the registrant requirements of Form S-3, i.e. , it must be “seasoned” <sup>93</sup> and generally must have at least $700 million in public float. <sup>94</sup> An issuer is not eligible for WKSI status if, among other bases: (1) it is not current and timely in its Exchange Act reports, or (2) it is the subject of a judicial oradministrative decree or order arising out of a governmental action involving violationsof the anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities laws (the “anti-fraud prong” of the ineligible issuer definition). <sup>95</sup>

<h>1. WKSI Definition</h>

As proposed, we are amending rule <sup>405</sup> to delete the exclusion of affected funds from the definition of WKSI. <sup>96</sup> In addition, we are adopting, as proposed, an amendment to the WKSI definition to include a reference to the registrant requirements of the proposed short-form registration instruction on Form N-2. <sup>97</sup> We received no comments on our proposal to make these particular amendments to rule 405. Commenters generally supported permitting affected funds to qualify as WKSIs. <sup>98</sup>

<h>2. WKSI Eligibility</h>

The BDC Act directed us to amend Securities Act rule 405 to allow a BDC to qualify as a WKSI, and the Registered CEF Act directed us to allow a registered CEF covered by the Act to use the securities offering rules that are available to operatingcompanies. <sup>99</sup> Consistent with these directives, and to provide parity in the offering rules for affected funds and operating companies, we are adopting, as proposed, amendments to allow affected funds to qualify as WKSIs if they satisfy the same $700 million public float requirement that applies to operating companies.

Our securities offering rules provide WKSIs with certain registration and communication flexibilities because, among other reasons, they have a demonstrated market following ( i.e. , they are “well-known”). <sup>100</sup> The Commission has used public float as an approximate measure of an issuer’s market following and the extent to which the market absorbs information about the issuer that is ultimately reflected in the price of the issuer’s securitie s . <sup>101</sup> The $700 million public float requirement is meant to encompass issuers that are presumptively the most widely followed in the marketplace and whose(“Forms S-3 and F-3 recognize the applicability of the efficient market theory to those companies which provide a steady stream of high quality corporate information to the marketplace and whose corporate information is broadly disseminated. Information about these companies is constantly digested and synthesized by financial analysts, who act as essential conduits in the continuous flow of information to investors, and is broadly disseminated on a timely basis by the financial press and other participants in the marketplace.”) ; see also Covered Investment Fund Research Reports, Investment Company Act Release No. 33311 (Nov. 30, 2018) [83 FR 64180 (Dec. 13, 2018)](“Covered Investment Fund Research Reports Adopting Release”).disclosures and other communications therefore are subject to market scrutiny by investors, the financial press, analysts, and others. <sup>102</sup>

Although the comments we received generally supported permitting affected funds to qualify as WKSIs, commenters also suggested specific modifications to the proposed amendments to permit certain additional affected funds to qualify. Several commenters recommended that we eliminate the public float requirement for affected funds . <sup>103</sup> Other commenters recommended that we adopt a substantially lower publicfloat threshold for affected funds, among other reasons, to make WKSI status available to a greater percentage of affected funds that have listed securities. <sup>104</sup> One such commenter offered a specific suggestion: that we reduce the public float threshold for affected funds from $700 million to $480 million. <sup>105</sup> This commenter stated that the $700 million public float requirement adopted in <sup>2005</sup> for operating companies permitted approximately 30% of operating companies to qualify as WKSIs, and stated that we should seek to achieve a$480 million as an alternative to its recommendation that we eliminate the public float requirement for affected funds). See supra footnote <sup>103</sup> .similar 30% “target” by adopting a $480 million public float requirement for affected funds.

As the basis for the recommended elimination of or modification to the $700 million public float requirement for affected funds, these commenters stated that while affected funds may not have the same level of market following as operating companies with the requisite public float, market following is a less relevant standard for affected funds than it is for operating companies. These commenters suggested that certain distinguishing characteristics of affected funds compensate for their relative lack of market following and corresponding market scrutiny. For example, commenters stated that affected funds, as pass-through investment vehicles, have a less complex business than traditional operating companies, and thus require less market scruti ny . <sup>106</sup> Commenters also stated that market scrutiny is less relevant for affected funds because, unlike operating companies, affected funds must satisfy the investor protection requirements of the Investment Company Act and related Commission rules, including requirements relating to financial transparency, valuation of portfolio securities,transactions with affiliates, and board oversight, among others . <sup>107</sup>

Similarly, on the basis that public float is not a suitable criterion for determining WKSI status for affected funds, commenters also urged that we permit unlisted affected funds (which do not have public float) to qualify for WKSI status on the basis of theiraggregate NAVs. <sup>108</sup> In addition to the reasons provided by commenters, discussed above, for eliminating or modifying the public float requirement, <sup>109</sup> these commenters stated that the intermediaries and distribution platforms through which unlisted affected funds are sold perform extensive due diligence on unlisted affected funds, resulting in these funds being subject to scrutiny “equal” to the market scrutiny indicated by a large publicfloat. <sup>110</sup> Commenters also stated that technological advancements have made unlistedaffected funds’ financial disclosures directly accessible to investors, and that, particularly in light of the extensive disclosure funds provide, investors are less dependent on market analysts for financial information. <sup>111</sup>

After considering these comments, we are adopting, as proposed, WKSI requirements for affected funds that are in parity with the requirements for operating companies. We are not eliminating or modifying the $700 million public float

See supra footnotes <sup>106</sup> – <sup>107</sup> and accompanying text.requirement for affected funds, or permitting affected funds to qualify as WKSIs based on their aggregate NAVs. Our amendments will implement the BDC Act and Registered CEF Act, and are designed to provide parity in the offering rules for affected funds and operating companies.

As discussed above, commenters stated that there are certain distinctions between affected funds and operating companies that suggest that the $700 million public float requirement is not an appropriate criterion for determining WKSI status for affected funds. For example, commenters noted that affected funds generally have less complex businesses than operating companies, are subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, and provide extensive financial information to the market. We agree with commenters that the WKSI framework, which the Commission designed specifically for operating companies, is not well-tailored to the specific characteristics of affected funds. However, these rules are designed to provide WKSI status to issuers with a demonstrated market following, and the Commission has for many years used public float, based on a public trading market, as an approximate measure of a stock’s market following and, consequently, the degree of efficiency with which the market absorbs information andreflects it in the price of a security. <sup>112</sup> Moreover, the offering rules for operating companies, which Congress specifically directed the Commission to extend to certain affected funds, are not premised on the characteristics of specific types of issuers, such aswhether an issuer’s business is less complex than other issuers’ businesses or whether an issuer is subject to different regulatory requirements. Further, the market following forclosed-end funds is significantly less robust than is the case for operating companies. As a result, in our view, it would not be appropriate to select a public float figure that is below the figure used to determine WKSI status for operating companies.

We also are not persuaded by commenters that allowing an affected fund, including an unlisted affected fund, to qualify on the basis of its aggregate NAV would be consistent with the requirements for an issuer to qualify as a WKSI, which Congress directed us to extend to affected funds. <sup>113</sup> In addition, permitting unlisted affected funds to qualify as WKSIs based on their aggregate NAVs would result in disparate treatment between unlisted affected funds and similarly situated operating companies under theserules. For example, unlisted real estate investment trusts (“unlisted REITs”) do not have apublic float and therefore generally cannot qualify as WKSIs under the rules forwould be consistent with the Registered CEF Act to provide these unlisted registered CEFs with new criteria for qualifying as WKSIs. Indeed, legislative language that preceded the passage of the Registered CEF Act would have applied to all registered closed-end investment companies, but the legislation enacted as the Registered CEF Act was subsequently narrowed in scope to apply only to listed closed-end funds and interval funds. Compare the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017, H.R. 10, 115th Cong. section 499A(a) (June 8, 2017) (directing us to revise rules to the extent necessary to allow a closed-end company, as defined in section 5(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act, that is registered as an investment company under the Act to use the securities offering and proxy rules that are available to other issuers that are required to file reports under section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) with section 509(a) of Registered CEF Act. See also 163 Cong. Rec. H4791, H4792 (2017) (daily ed. June 8, 2017) (statement of Rep. Ellison) (stating that the prior bill would “allow even illiquid, nontraded funds to claim multiple exemptions,” making it “harder for the … Commission … to police these products for investors”).operating companies. Unlisted REITs, however, have many of the characteristics that commenters cited in support of permitting unlisted affected funds to use their aggregate NAVs to qualify as WKSIs. <sup>114</sup> Nonetheless, unlisted REITs and other unlisted operating companies may not qualify as WKSIs unless they have the requisite public float or satisfy one of the alternative bases (which we also are adopting for affected funds).

Moreover, many of the distinctions between affected funds and operatingcompanies that commenters raised are based on the characteristics of registered funds and BDCs generally, and are not unique to affected funds. We believe that the particularcharacteristics of registered funds, including affected funds, may be appropriate for the Commission to examine as part of a more comprehensive consideration of whether the securities offering rules for funds should be modified rather than in this rulemakingrelated to affected funds specifically. <sup>115</sup>

We do not agree with the commenters who stated that changing or eliminating the WKSI requirements for affected funds would be consistent with the intent of the Acts.

We do not believe, as commenters suggested, that the BDC Act and Registered CEF Act were designed to result in a higher percentage of affected funds qualifying for WKSImillion public float requirement and thus cannot qualify as WKSIs under the rules for operating companies.status. <sup>116</sup> Rather, as discussed above, the Acts directed us to extend to affected funds the benefits of our securities offering rules that are available to operating companies. We believe that designing specific WKSI requirements for affected funds to permit a particular percentage of those funds to qualify as WKSIs would not provide parity oftreatment. Moreover, the $700 million public float requirement for operating companies was not designed to result in a certain percentage of operating companies qualifying as WKSIs, as suggested by the commenter who recommended that the public float requirement for affected funds be lowered to $480 million. <sup>117</sup> In describing the $700 million public float threshold for operating companies, the Commission observed that the threshold would make the WKSI provisions available to approximately 30% of listed issuers, but this was describing the effect of the provision and not its intent. <sup>118</sup>

We also do not agree with commenters that the Registered CEF Act, by referring to interval funds, requires us to permit affected funds to qualify as WKSIs based oncriteria other than the criteria that apply to operating companies. <sup>119</sup> The Registered CEF

Act directed us to allow interval funds (in addition to listed CEFs) to use the securities offering rules that are available to other issuers required to file reports under section <sup>13</sup> or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. <sup>120</sup> As discussed throughout this release and summarized in

Tables 1 and 2 above, the rules that we are amending in this release are available to all affected funds, including interval funds, that satisfy the relevant conditions of those rules. In addition, many of the rules we are amending are not conditioned on an issuer’s public float, such as the amendments to permit affected funds to use the “access equals delivery” prospectus delivery framework available to operating companies.

We are adopting certain targeted amendments to permit certain non-interval affected funds to rely on rule 486 under the Securities Act. Unlike the WKSIrequirements, rule <sup>486</sup> is specifically designed to apply to funds. These amendments to rule <sup>486</sup> will permit certain registered CEFs and BDCs that conduct continuous offerings—regardless of whether they qualify as WKSIs—to file post-effective amendments and certain registration statements that become either effective immediately upon filing under rule 486(b) or automatically effective after <sup>60</sup> days under rule486(a). <sup>121</sup> Similar to the benefits the final rule will provide to affected funds that qualify as WKSIs or that are eligible to file short-form registration statements, these amendments will facilitate certain unlisted affected funds’ ability to raise capital without delay by allowing the funds to more efficiently maintain effective registration statements while they engage in continuous offerings. The final rule, therefore, will provide certain listedaffected funds with the flexibility to use a short-form registration statement and to file registration statements and amendments that become effective automatically.

Additionally, unlisted affected funds generally will have the flexibility to make filingsthat become effective either immediately upon filing or automatically after <sup>60</sup> days. Thus the final rule will provide additional flexibilities to both listed and unlisted affected funds.

<h>3. Ineligible Issuer Definition</h>

We are adopting, as proposed, amendments to the definition of ineligible issuer in rule 405. Although all of the provisions in the ineligible issuer definition would apply to affected funds, our amendments are designed to tailor certain of these provisions foraffected funds specifically. First, we are amending the definition of “ineligible issuer” to provide that a registered CEF would be ineligible if it has failed to file all reports and materials required to be filed under section 30 of the Investment Company Act during the preceding 12 months. This provision is consistent with the proposed short-form registration instruction and would mirror the current Exchange Act reporting provision in the ineligible issuer definition. <sup>122</sup> We did not receive any comments on this particular proposed amendment.

Second, we are adopting, as proposed, an amendment to the definition of ineligible issuer to give effect to the definition’s anti-fraud prong in the context ofaffected funds. Specifically, we are adopting a parallel anti-fraud prong for affectedfunds, which provides that an affected fund is an ineligible issuer if within the past three years its investment adviser, including any sub-adviser, was the subject of any judicial oradministrative decree or order arising out of a governmental action that determines the investment adviser aided or abetted or caused the affected fund to have violated the anti- fraud provisions of the Federal securities laws. <sup>123</sup> We believe this amendment isappropriate because investment companies typically are externally managed by an investment adviser, which is primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the fund and the preparation of the fund’s disclosures. <sup>124</sup>

We received several comments requesting that we clarify or modify certain aspects of the proposed amendments. Commenters suggested that we clarify that a violation of section 206(4) of the Advisers Act, or the rules adopted under section 206(4) (except for <sup>17</sup> CFR 275.206(4)-8 (rule 206(4)-8)), by an affected fund's investment adviser or sub-adviser would not give rise to WKSI ineligibility for the affected fund. <sup>125</sup> These commenters also recommended that we modify the proposed anti-fraud provision so that an affected fund would not be an ineligible issuer if the investment adviser (or sub-adviser) that was the subject of a judicial or administrative decree or order asdescribed in the proposed rule no longer advises the affected fund at the time the affected fund seeks WKSI status. <sup>126</sup>

Under the anti-fraud prong for affected funds, an affected fund is ineligible for WKSI status if the affected fund’s adviser or sub-adviser is determined to have aided or abetted or caused a violation by the fund of the anti-fraud provisions of the Federalsecurities laws. As such, only the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws that apply tothe affected fund itself can give rise to WKSI ineligibility. There could not be a violation of section 206(4) or the rules adopted thereunder by an affected fund, because the fund is not itself an adviser.

We also do not believe it would be appropriate, as commenters suggested, to modify the proposed amendments to permit an affected fund whose adviser or sub-adviser was determined to have aided or abetted or caused a violation by the fund of theanti-fraud provisions of the securities laws to preserve its WKSI eligibility by terminating the adviser or sub-adviser. <sup>127</sup> An operating company currently will be an ineligible issuer under the anti-fraud prong even if the operating company terminates all of the employees who aided or abetted the underlying violation of the Federal securities laws, and ouramendments will provide comparable treatment if an affected fund were to terminate its adviser. The affected fund also may have the same board of directors that was in place when the affected fund violated the anti-fraud provisions. The specific facts andcircumstances relating to a particular issuer’s WKSI status under the ineligible issuer definition may, however, be considered through the Commission’s process under rule <sup>405</sup> for granting waivers of ineligible issuer status. <sup>128</sup>

For these reasons, we are adopting the amendments to the ineligible issuer definition as proposed.

<h>D. Automatic or Imme diate Effectiveness for Filings by Affected Funds Conducting Certain Continuous Offe rings</h>

Based on comments that we received, we are expanding the scope of rule <sup>486</sup> to permit any registered CEF or BDC that conducts continuous offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(ix) ( e.g. , a continuously-offered tender offer fund) to rely on the rule. Rule <sup>486</sup> under the Securities Act currently permits interval funds to file post-effective amendments and certain registration statements that are either immediately effective upon filing under rule 486(b) or automatically effective <sup>60</sup> days after filing under rule486(a). <sup>129</sup>

As discussed in the Proposing Release, our staff has previously stated that it would not recommend that the Commission take enforcement action under certain provisions of the Securities Act if, on a case-by-case basis, specific listed registered CEFs that conduct offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(x) use rule 486(b) to file certain post-effective amendments that are immediately effective upon filing. <sup>130</sup> The Proposing Release noted that staff in the Division of Investment Management were reviewing these no-action letters to determine if they should be withdrawn in connection with any final rules. The Commission also requested comment on whether it should make rule 486(b) available toall or a broader group of registered CEFs and BDCs. <sup>131</sup> In response to this request,several commenters asked that we allow certain non-interval funds that conduct delayed or continuous offerings under rule <sup>415</sup> to rely on rule 486, in whole or in part. <sup>132</sup> Forexample, one commenter suggested that the existing no-action letters be retained orcodified. This commenter stated that withdrawing the no-action letters would be disruptive to relevant non-WKSI funds and their ability to update their registration statements and receive automatic effectiveness. <sup>133</sup> Additionally, two commentersrecommended that we permit affected funds that are continuously-offered unlisted funds to rely on rule <sup>486</sup> in its entirety, including rule 486(a) and rule 486(b). The commenters suggested that, like interval funds, these unlisted funds are continuously offered and would benefit if their filings could become immediately effective or automaticallyeffective <sup>60</sup> days after filing. <sup>134</sup> One of these commenters stated that, for example, allowing continuously-offered unlisted affected funds to rely on rule <sup>486</sup> would benefit investors in these funds by allowing the funds to avoid the time and expense of an annual staff review of registration statements where no changes are made beyond immaterial updates and updates to audited financial information. <sup>135</sup>

In response to these comments, we are amending rule 486 to allow any registered CEF or BDC that conducts a continuous offering under rule 415(a)(1)(ix) to rely on rule486. <sup>136</sup> We believe this rule amendment will allow these continuously-offered affected funds to maintain effective registration statements in a more efficient, cost-effective manner. For example, under rule 486(a), these funds will be able to make material changes to their registration statements on an automatically effective basis 60 days after filing. In addition, under rule 486(b), continuously-offered unlisted affected funds will be able, for example, to update their financial statements under section 10(a)(3) or makenon-material changes to their registration statements on an immediately effective basis. The rule amendment will allow these funds to more efficiently maintain effective registration statements while they engage in continuous offerings. This is similar to the benefits the final rule will provide to affected funds that file short-form registration statements or qualify as WKSIs, as those funds also will be able to make certain updates to their registration statements more efficiently ( i.e. , through forward incorporation by reference or automatically effective registration statements and post-effectiveamendments). <sup>137</sup> We believe it is appropriate for any affected fund that conducts delayed or continuous offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(ix), (x), or (xi) to have a mechanism forbringing its financial statements up to date under section 10(a)(3) without delay. <sup>138</sup> Together, the amendments we are adopting in this release and current rule <sup>486</sup> will achieve this objective.

Continuously-offered unlisted affected funds relying on rule <sup>486</sup> will continue to be subject to applicable provisions in rule 415. <sup>139</sup> Moreover, these funds will need to comply with relevant conditions in rule 486. <sup>140</sup> If it appears to the Commission that a post-effective amendment or registration statement filed under rule 486(a) may beincomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, the Commission may suspend the effective date of that filing. Further, if it appears to the Commission that the fund has not complied with the conditions in rule 486(b), the Commission may suspend the fund’s ability to rely on rule 486(b). <sup>141</sup>

In addition to allowing an affected fund to rely on rule 486 if the fund makes continuous offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(ix), we are also amending the scope of registration statements that rule 486 covers. Currently, rule 486 is available for post-effective amendments and for registration statements filed for purposes of registering additional shares of common stock for which a Form N-2 registration statement iseffective. This generally reflects the scope of amendments and registration statement filings interval funds make after their initial registration statements are effective.

However, unlike interval funds, the affected funds that will newly be eligible to rely on rule <sup>486</sup> generally are required to file new registration statements every three years under rule 415(a)(5) and (6). We are amending rule <sup>486</sup> to allow these registration statements to be immediately or automatically effective under the rule, depending on the substance of the disclosure. <sup>142</sup> Specifically, a registration statement a fund files to comply with rule 415(a)(5) and (6) could be immediately effective upon filing if it is filed for no purpose other than to comply with those provisions of rule <sup>415</sup> or for other purposes listed in rule 486(b), such as making non-material changes or updating the fund’s financial statements under section 10(a)(3). If the registration statement does not qualify under rule 486(b) because, for example, it includes material changes to the fund’s disclosure, theregistration statement could be automatically effective <sup>60</sup> days after filing under rule 486(a). As a result of the amendments, affected funds that make continuous offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(ix) will be able to rely on rule <sup>486</sup> for registration statements filed to comply with rule 415(a)(5) and (6), regardless of whether they choose to registeradditional shares at the time these provisions requires them to file new registration statements. This will promote consistent treatment of these funds’ filings under the rule.

Although one commenter suggested that we retain or codify the staff no-action letters discussed above to allow affected funds that conduct delayed or continuous offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(x) to file post-effective amendments that are immediately effective under rule 486(b), we believe the final rule makes such relief unnecessary. <sup>143</sup> For example, while these funds will need to file new registration statements every three years under rule 415, during the interim period they will be able to update their registration statements through the forward incorporation by reference provisions applicable to short-form registration statement filers. <sup>144</sup> The forward incorporation by reference provisions allow these funds to avoid filing the types of post-effective amendments that rule 486(b) covers, as well as other types of post-effective amendments ( e.g. , those making material changes to the fund’s disclosure). Thus, we do not believe that affected funds that make delayed or continuous offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(x) will need to file the types of post-effective amendments rule 486(b) covers.

Moreover, while the commenter only referred to post-effective amendments, rule 486(b) also covers new registration statements under certain circumstances. For instance, when an eligible fund has an effective registration statement and wants to register additional shares without making material amendments to its existing disclosure, rule 486(b) allows that new registration statement to be immediately effective. <sup>145</sup> If we were to permit a fund that makes delayed or continuous offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(x) to rely on rule 486(b) in its entirety, then the new registration statement the fund must fileevery three years could effectively become an automatic shelf registration statement, even though the fund does not qualify as a WKSI ( e.g. , it does not have $700 million in public float). <sup>146</sup> As a result of these considerations, the no-action letters stating that the staff would not recommend an enforcement action if specific listed, registered CEFs conducted offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(x) using rule 486(b) will be withdrawn effective August 1, <sup>2021</sup> (one year from the effective date of the final rule). <sup>147</sup> Importantly, as recognized above, the final amendments provide a mechanism for these funds to efficiently update their registration statements.

<h>E. Final Prospe ctus Delivery Re forms</h>

We are adopting, as proposed, rule amendments that will allow an affected fund to satisfy its final prospectus delivery obligations by filing its final prospectus with the Commission.

The Securities Act requires registrants to deliver to each investor in a registered offering a prospectus meeting the requirements of section 10(a) (known as a “final prospectus”). <sup>148</sup> Section 5(b)(2) makes it unlawful to deliver a security for the purpose of sale or for delivery after sale unless accompanied or preceded by a final prospectus. Afteris not effective immediately. See rule 486(a).the effectiveness of a registration statement, a written communication that offers a security for sale, or confirms the sale of a security, may be provided to investors if a final prospectus is sent or given previously or at the same time. Otherwise, such a communication may not be provided unless it is otherwise permitted under Commission rules or meets the requirements of section 10(a). <sup>149</sup>

Rule <sup>172</sup> allows issuers, brokers, and dealers to satisfy final prospectus delivery obligations if a final prospectus is or will be on file with the Commission within the time required by the rules and other conditions are satisfied. <sup>150</sup> For example, rule 172 provides that a final prospectus will be deemed to precede or accompany a security for sale for purposes of section 5(b)(2) as long as the final prospectus is filed with the Commission or it will be filed as part of the registration statement. <sup>151</sup> Rule <sup>172</sup> applies only to final prospectuses and not to other documents. <sup>152</sup> Rule <sup>173</sup> requires the delivery of a copy of the final prospectus or, in lieu of a final prospectus, a notice to purchasers stating that a sale of securities was made pursuant to a registration statement or in a transaction in which a final prospectus would have been required to have been delivered in the absence of rule <sup>172</sup> . <sup>153</sup>

Rules <sup>172</sup> and <sup>173</sup> do not apply to offerings of affected funds. <sup>154</sup> The BDC Act directs us to remove the exclusion for BDC offerings. <sup>155</sup> To implement the BDC Act, and to provide parity for registered CEFs consistent with the Registered CEF Act, we proposed to amend rules <sup>172</sup> and <sup>173</sup> to remove the exclusion for offerings of all affected funds. Commenters supported this approach, stating that the proposed amendments would reduce prospectus printing and delivery costs and provide parity for affected funds, consistent with the BDC Act and the Registered CEF Act. <sup>156</sup> We are adopting the amendments to rules <sup>172</sup> and <sup>173</sup> as proposed. <sup>157</sup>

<h>F. Communications Reforms</h>

<h>1. Offering Communications</h>

We are adopting amendments to the communications rules, as proposed, to extend to affected funds the rules that currently provide operating companies and other parties (such as underwriters) increased flexibility in their communications. <sup>158</sup> The amendments permit these communications notwithstanding the “gun-jumping provisions” in theunder which funds currently undertake to provide an SAI upon request, to require an affected fund to also undertake to provide a prospectus upon request. We received no comments regarding this aspect of the proposal and are making the change as proposed. See Item 34.7 of amended Form N-2.

Securities Act, which restrict the types of offering communications that issuers or other parties subject to the Act’s provisions may use in connection with a registered public offering. <sup>159</sup> The gun-jumping provisions were designed to make the statutorily mandated prospectus the primary means for investors to obtain information regarding a registered securities offering. <sup>160</sup> Accordingly, the statute provides that unless otherwise permitted:

Before an issuer files a registration statement, all offers, in whatever form, are prohibited; <sup>161</sup>

After the issuer files a registration statement but before it has become effective,the only written offers that are permitted are those made using a preliminary prospectus that meets the requirements of section 10 of the Securities Act, which must be filed with the Commission; <sup>162</sup> andwritten, printed, a radio or television broadcast, or a graphic communication as defined in [rule 405].”

Even after the registration statement is declared effective, offering participants still may make written offers only through a statutory prospectus, except that they may use additional written offering materials if a final prospectus that meets the requirements of Securities Act section 10(a) is sent or given prior to or with those materials. <sup>163</sup>

Since the adoption of the Securities Act, the Commission has recognized that certain communications before, during, and after the filing of a registration statement do not raise the investor protection concerns that the gun jumping provisions aim to address. For this reason, the Commission has adopted several rules to provide clarity to issuers on the types of communications that are permissible and how to communicate with investors without violating the gun jumping provisions. We proposed to extend those rules to affected funds in the Proposing Release. Commenters generally supported the proposed amendments to the communications rules. <sup>164</sup> Two commenters stated that the amendments would allow increased flexibility in communications and provide parity withoperating companies. <sup>165</sup> One commenter added that the amendments would make it easier to execute offerings by affected funds and would decrease costs, leading to lower offering

Securities Act. See sections 5(b)(1) and 10 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77e(b)(1) and 77(j)].costs and potentially enhance capital formation while not negatively impacting investor protections. <sup>166</sup>

The Commission continues to believe that investors and the market will benefit from access to greater communications under conditions that preserve investor protections. To implement the BDC Act, and to provide parity for registered CEFs consistent with the Registered CEF Act, we are extending, as proposed, the communications rules currently available to operating companies to affected funds by removing the exclusions for affected funds and making other conforming changes. <sup>167</sup> Specifically, the amended rules will:

Permit affected funds to use rule <sup>134</sup> to publish factual information about the issuer or the offering, including “tombstone ads.” <sup>168</sup>

Permit affected funds to rely on rule 163A, which provides issuers a bright-line time period, ending <sup>30</sup> days prior to filing a registration statement, during which they may communicate without risk of violating the gun-jumping provisions. <sup>169</sup>

See also amended rule 168 (adding to paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) references to the Investment Company Act to parallel current references to the Exchange Act to provide that forward-looking information and factual business information may be included in materials filed under the Investment Company Act); amended rule 433 (adding toparagraphs (a)(1)(i) and (iv) references to registration statements filed on Form N-2 underadopted General Instruction A.2 to parallel current references to Form S-3; adding to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) a reference to reports filed under section 30 of the Investment Company Act as reports with which a free-writing prospectus may not conflict). See also amended rule 156(d); infra footnote <sup>172</sup> .

Permit affected funds that are reporting companies to rely on rule <sup>168</sup> to publish or disseminate regularly released factual business information and forward- looking information at any time, including around the time of a registered offering. <sup>170</sup> The amendments to rule <sup>169</sup> will also permit affected funds’ continued publication or dissemination of regularly released factual business information that is intended for use by persons other than in their capacity as investors or potential investors. <sup>171</sup> We also are adopting amendments to rule <sup>156</sup> to state that nothing in that rule may be construed to prevent an affected fund from qualifying for an exemption under rule <sup>168</sup> or <sup>169</sup> . <sup>172</sup> The contents of any rule <sup>168</sup> or <sup>169</sup> communication remain subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities laws.

Permit affected funds to rely on rules <sup>164</sup> and <sup>433</sup> to use a “free writing prospectus.” <sup>173</sup>

Permit affected funds that are WKSIs to engage at any time in oral and written communications, including use at any time of a free writing prospectus (before or after a registration statement is filed), subject to the same conditions applicable to other WKSIs. <sup>174</sup>

As we discussed in the Proposing Release, investment company communications currently are subject to rule 482. <sup>175</sup> Rule <sup>482</sup> communications can only be used by a fund that is selling or is proposing to sell its securities pursuant to a filed registrationstatement, and are prospectuses subject to prospectus liability under section 12 of the Securities Act. <sup>176</sup> The amendments to the communications rules provide affected funds with incremental flexibility in their communications, including additional flexibility to communicate before filing a registration statement, and some additional flexibility in using communications that are not subject to prospectus liability under section 12 of the

Securities Act. <sup>177</sup> Moreover, as we discussed in the Proposing Release, both the BDC Act and Registered CEF Act direct the Commission to continue to make available Securities Act rule <sup>482</sup> communications, or “ads,” notwithstanding the amendments to the communications rules. <sup>178</sup> Affected funds therefore can now take advantage of additional flexibility under the communications rules as amended or continue to rely on rule <sup>482</sup> and other rules currently applicable to investment company communications.

In addition to comments on the proposed amendments to the communications rules, two commenters urged us to adopt rules that would extend the safe harbors forliability in private actions for certain forward looking statements under section 27A of the Securities Act and section 21E of the Exchange Act to affected funds. <sup>179</sup> Those commenters did not specify what the conditions or requirements of such a rule might be, and the public has not had the opportunity to comment on whether or how to extend safe harbors for forward-looking statements to affected funds. For these reasons, we believecommenters’ request requires more extensive consideration beyond the scope of this rulemaking.

<h>2. Brok er-Dealer Research Reports</h>

We are adopting the amendments to Securities Act rule <sup>138</sup> as proposed. Rule <sup>138</sup> permits a broker-dealer participating in the registered offering of an eligible issuer’s common stock and similar securities to publish or distribute research reports about that issuer’s fixed income securities, and vice versa, if it publishes or distributes that research in the regular course of its business.

Although rule <sup>138</sup> does not currently exclude affected funds from coverage, it does include references to Form S-3 but not Form N-2. We therefore proposed to amend the rule’s references to shelf registration statements filed on Form S-3 to include aparallel reference to a registration statement filed on Form N-2 under the proposed short- form registration instruction. Rule <sup>138</sup> also currently provides that an issuer covered in a research report published in reliance on the rule must be required to file reports, and must have filed all periodic reports required during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter

U.S.C. 78u-5(g)].time that the issuer was required to file such reports), on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. <sup>180</sup>

Because registered CEFs do not file the periodic reports currently specified in rule 138, we proposed to include parallel references to the reports that registered CEFs are required to file, i.e. , reports on Forms N-CSR, N-Q, N-CEN, and N-PORT. <sup>181</sup> We did not receive any comments on these amendments and are adopting them as proposed.

We are not adopting changes to <sup>17</sup> CFR 230.139 (rule 139). <sup>182</sup> That rule provides a safe harbor for a broker-dealer’s publication or distribution of research reports where the broker-dealer is participating in the registered offering of the issuer’s securities and, unlike rule 138, permits the research report to cover any class of the issuer’s securities.

As we stated in the Proposing Release, in <sup>2018</sup> the Commission adopted new <sup>17</sup> CFR 230.139b (Securities Act rule 139b) to implement the Fair Access to Investment Research Act of <sup>2017</sup> (the “FAIR Act”). <sup>183</sup> The FAIR Act directed that the Commission extend rule <sup>139</sup> to cover broker-dealers’ publication or distribution of “covered investment fund research reports.” These include research reports about affected funds. <sup>184</sup>

Rule 139b includes specific provisions mandated by Congress for covered investment fund research reports. For example, rule 139b excludes from the rule’s safeharbor research reports published or distributed by the covered investment fund itself, any affiliate of the covered investment fund, or any broker-dealer that is an investment adviser (or an affiliated person of an investment adviser) for the covered investment fund. <sup>185</sup> The Commission did not propose changes to rule <sup>139</sup> because it believed that rule 139b satisfies the directives of the BDC Act and Registered CEF Act by extending rule 139’s safe harbor to research reports on BDCs and registered CEFs and is consistent with Congress’s core objective regarding research reports covering these funds. <sup>186</sup> The Commission observed that, if it were to amend rule <sup>139</sup> to cover research reports on BDCs, or on affected funds generally, exactly the same conduct would be subject to different standards based on the rule a broker-dealer chose to use. <sup>187</sup> The Commission believed that it would be more appropriate to provide a consistent approach for affected fund research reports under rule 139b. <sup>188</sup>

One commenter suggested that we amend rule <sup>139</sup> and repeal rule 139b, in order to provide the same requirements for broker-dealer research reports on affected funds and operating companies. <sup>189</sup> The commenter raised concerns regarding differences between these two rules’ requirements, such as rule 139b’s “affiliate exclusion.” That provision makes rule 139b’s safe harbor inapplicable to research reports by a broker-dealer that isan investment adviser (or an affiliated person of an investment adviser) to the covered investment fund.

We acknowledged the differences between rule 139b and rule 139 in the Proposing Release. Indeed, the different requirements in rule 139b—which were mandated by Congress in the FAIR Act—are why we did not propose amendments torule 139. We continue to believe that rule 139b already satisfies the directives of the BDC Act and Registered CEF Act by extending rule 139’s safe harbor to research reports on BDCs and registered CEFs and is consistent with Congress’s core objective regarding research reports covering these funds. If we were to amend rule <sup>139</sup> and rescind rule139b as urged by this commenter, this would not give effect to Congress’s more specific directives in the FAIR Act. Moreover, rule 139b, as directed by the FAIR Act, provides a consistent framework for research reports on “covered investment funds,” which are not limited to the affected funds covered in this rulemaking. Maintaining rule 139b therefore provides a consistent approach for all “covered investment fund research reports.”

<h>G. Other Rule Amendme nts</h>

<h>1. Rule 418 Supplemental Information</h>

As proposed, we are adopting amendments to rule <sup>418</sup> to exempt affected funds that are eligible to file a short-form registration statement on Form N-2 from the requirement to furnish certain supplemental information to the Commission or staff on request under paragraph (a)(3) of the rule. As discussed in the Proposing Release, operating companies that are eligible to use Form S-3 are already exempt from having tofurnish certain information under rule 418(a)(3). <sup>190</sup> Commenters did not address the amendments to rule 418, which we proposed to implement the BDC Act and to provide parity for registered CEFs consistent with the Registered CEF Act. <sup>191</sup> Consistent with the proposal, affected funds that are eligible to file a short-form registration statement on Form N-2 will not be required to furnish, on request, recent engineering, management, or similar reports or memoranda relating to broad aspects of the business, operations, or products of the registrant under amended rule 418(a)(3). <sup>192</sup>

<h>2. Amendments to Incorporation by Reference into Proxy Statements</h>

We are adopting amendments to Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act as proposed, consistent with the BDC Act and the Registered CEF Act. <sup>193</sup> We did not receive comments on the proposed amendments to Schedule 14A. The amendments will allow affected funds that meet the requirements of the short-form registration instruction in Form N-2, as further described in Note E to Schedule 14A, to incorporate certain information by reference to previously-filed documents for proxy statements containing specific proposals under Item 13 of Schedule 14A. <sup>194</sup> The amendments allow eligible funds to incorporate by reference certain required information for relevant proxyproposals to the same extent that operating companies meeting the requirements of Form S-3 (as defined in Note E to Schedule 14A) may use incorporation by reference under the same circumstances. <sup>195</sup>

<h>3. Rule 103 of Regulation FD</h>

We are adopting amendments to rule 103(a) of Regulation FD, as proposed, to provide that an affected fund’s failure to make a public disclosure required solely by rule <sup>100</sup> of Regulation FD will not affect the fund’s eligibility under the short-form registration instruction of Form N-2. <sup>196</sup> We did not receive comments on the proposed amendments to rule 103(a). The final amendments to rule 103(a) will enhance parity between affected funds and operating companies, consistent with the BDC Act and the Registered CEF Act, as rule 103(a) already provides that an operating company’s failure to make a public disclosure required solely by rule <sup>100</sup> of Regulation FD will not affect its eligibility to use Form S-3. <sup>197</sup>

<h>H. New Registration Fe e Payme nt Method for Inte rval Funds and Issue rs of Certain Exchange -Trade d Products</h>

We are adopting a modernized approach to registration fee payment that will require interval funds to pay securities registration fees using the same method that mutual funds and ETFs use today. <sup>198</sup> Specifically, for interval funds, the final rule will provide that such funds register an indefinite amount of securities upon their registration statements’ effectiveness. <sup>199</sup> Like mutual funds and ETFs, interval funds will be required to pay registration fees based on their net issuance of shares, no later than <sup>90</sup> days after the funds’ fiscal year ends. <sup>200</sup> These issuers will be required to file information about the computation of this registration fee and other information on Form 24F-2 under the

Investment Company Act when paying the fee. <sup>201</sup> In response to comments that wereceived, we also are extending similar treatment to certain ETPs that are not registered under the Investment Company Act.

We proposed to amend rules 23c-3 and 24f-2 so that interval funds would payregistration fees on this same annual net basis. <sup>202</sup> The commenters who addressed this aspect of the proposal supported it. <sup>203</sup> Two commenters suggested expanding the scope of this aspect of our proposal to include additional types of issuers. <sup>204</sup> One commenter recommended extending the scope of the provision to “all other funds” to confer the same benefits to those additional funds, such as eliminating the need to predict the number of shares the fund expects to sell. <sup>205</sup> Another commenter suggested extending the scope to “tender offer funds”—those that make repurchase offers but that are not, like interval funds, required to periodically repurchase shares or to have a fundamental policy regarding its repurchase offers that can be changed only by a shareholder vote. <sup>206</sup> We are adopting this provision as proposed. Of the categories of investment companiescontemplated by commenters, only interval funds routinely repurchase shares at NAV and are required to periodically offer to repurchase their shares, making these funds more like mutual funds and ETFs, which are required to use this method.

In response to a request for comment in the Proposing Release, a number of commenters also recommended that certain ETPs that are not registered under the

Investment Company Act be permitted to register offerings of an indefinite number of securities and pay registration fees in a manner equivalent to that under rule 24f-2. <sup>207</sup>

These commenters stated that these ETPs operate in a manner substantially similar to that of ETFs and would similarly benefit from paying registration fees on an annual net basis and from registering offerings of an indefinite number of securities. <sup>208</sup> Some of these commenters also noted that the attributes cited in the Proposing Release for extending the ability to pay registration fees on an annual net basis to interval funds (routine repurchases of shares at NAV and avoiding the possibility that an interval fund would inadvertently sell more shares than it had registered) would also apply to these ETPs. <sup>209</sup>

After considering these comments, we have determined to adopt amendments to enable certain ETPs that are not registered under the Investment Company Act to elect to register an offering of an indeterminate number of securities and to pay registration feeswhen the ETPs invest in futures contracts and other investments that cannot be transferred in-kind. GraniteShares Comment Letter.for such an offering in a manner equivalent to that for mutual funds and ETFs ( i.e. , in arrears on an annual net basis). In view of the concerns raised by commenters as well as the similarities between these ETPs and ETFs, we agree that it is appropriate to extend the availability of this treatment to these ETPs under the Securities Act. Accordingly, issuers that offer exchange-traded vehicle securities, as the term will now be defined in amended rule 405, <sup>210</sup> will be eligible under new Securities Act rule 456(d) to elect to register an offering of an indeterminate amount of exchange-traded vehicle securities and pay registration fees for such an offering on an annual net basis no later than <sup>90</sup> daysafter the end of the fiscal year when making this election. We are also adopting Securities Act rule 457(u), which sets forth the calculation method for paying registration fees in this manner and is consistent with the fee calculation provisions of Form 24F-2. <sup>211</sup> Finally, we are adopting rule 424(i) pursuant to which issuers that elect to register an offering of an indeterminate amount of securities pursuant to rule 456(d) will be required to file a prospectus supplement when paying registration fees on an annual net basis. <sup>212</sup>

<h>I. Disclosure and Reporting Parity Proposals</h>

We are adopting amendments to our rules and forms, substantially as proposed, intended to tailor the disclosure and regulatory framework for affected funds in light ofour amendments to the offering rules. Many of these amendments are not required by the BDC Act or the Registered CEF Act, but we believe are consistent with the respective Acts’ requirements to increase regulatory parity of affected funds with otherwise similarly-situated issuers. <sup>213</sup> As discussed in detail below, these amendments include structured data requirements; new annual reporting requirements; amendments to provide all affected funds additional flexibility to incorporate information by reference; and enhancements to the disclosures that registered CEFs make to investors when the funds are not updating their registration statements.

<h>1. Structured Data Requirements</h>

We are adopting, substantially as proposed, certain new structured data reporting requirements for registered CEFs and BDCs. In particular, and as discussed in detailbelow, we are requiring:

BDCs, like operating companies, to submit financial statement information using Inline XBRL format;registered CEFs and BDCs to include structured cover page information in their registration statements on Form N-2 using Inline XBRL format;certain information required in an affected fund’s prospectus to be tagged using Inline XBRL format; andfilings on Form 24F-2 to be submitted in eXtensible Markup Language (“XML”) format.

<h>a. Inline XBRL Requirements for Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements</h>

We are adopting, as proposed, an amendment to <sup>17</sup> CFR 229.601 (Item <sup>601</sup> of Regulation S-K) to subject BDCs to the Inline XBRL financial statement tagging requirements that apply to operating companies, by removing the exclusion for BDCs from the Inline XBRL financial statement tagging requirements . <sup>214</sup> We continue to believe that reporting in a structured data format makes financial information easier for investors to analyze and helps automate regulatory filings and business information processing. <sup>215</sup> We also believe that BDC investors and other market participants would benefit from the availability of relevant information in a structured data format. <sup>216</sup> These requirements will reduce the current disparity between the accessibility of financial information BDCs provide to the market and the accessibility of substantially similar financial information that operating companies provide to the market. <sup>217</sup>

The commenters who addressed this proposed requirement supported it. <sup>218</sup> Some of these commenters stated that structured financial statement data would be more useful to investors than information in only a HyperText Markup Language (“HTML”) or plain text format. <sup>219</sup> One of these commenters stated that more structured financial statement reporting would improve the clarity and transparency of reported information by usingconsistent, agreed-upon definitions, and would yield information that is less expensive to process and more timely than unstructured data. <sup>220</sup> Another commenter stated that eliminating the delay for data users to obtain information once it is public makes capital markets more efficient. <sup>221</sup>

Two commenters supported the use of the Inline XBRL format specifically. <sup>222</sup> One of these commenters noted that, because Inline XBRL is both machine-readable and human-readable, it will help investors in BDCs quickly access structured data just as investors in operating companies can. <sup>223</sup> This commenter also highlighted potential benefits of the format for issuers, stating that data in Inline XBRL format is easier toreview than, for example, the same data in separate XBRL and HTML formats . <sup>224</sup> Somecommenters also stated that the currently available XBRL taxonomies will be sufficient for BDCs. <sup>225</sup> After considering public comments received, and because we continue to believe that investors will benefit from the availability of relevant information in a structured data format, we are adopting this requirement as proposed. <sup>226</sup>

<h>b. New Check Boxes and Structured Data Format for Form N-2 Cover Page Information</h>

We are adopting, as proposed, a requirement that all affected funds tag all of the data points that appear on the cover page of Form N-2, except the Calculation of

Registration Fee table, using Inline XBRL format . <sup>227</sup> These cover page data points willinclude, for example, the company name, the Act or Acts to which the registration statement relates, and check boxes relating to the effectiveness of the registrationstatement. We currently require operating companies to tag all of the data points on theapplications used to prepare XBRL for operating companies could be leveraged for BDCs, increasing economies of scale. XBRL US Comment Letter.would expect a greater use of non-standard reporting elements than for average operating companies. IRIS Comment Letter. We continue to believe that the relevant XBRL taxonomies are sufficiently well developed for use by BDCs, even if BDCs use non- standard elements more than the average operating company.

We also are making certain conforming revisions to proposed General Instruction H (Interactive Data Files), which we renumbered as General Instruction I of amended Form N-2. In addition, and as a result, we renumbered General Instruction I of current Form N- 2 (Registration of Additional Securities) as General Instruction J of amended Form N-2.cover page of Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Form 8-K, Form 20-F, and Form 40-F using Inline XBRL format. <sup>228</sup> The Commission generally proposed to extend this requirement to mandatory tagging of the data points on the cover page of Form N-2 because it believed it would allow investors, other market participants, and other data users to automate their use of this information. <sup>229</sup>

The commenters who addressed the proposed requirement supported it. <sup>230</sup> As above, two commenters supported the proposed Inline XBRL format, stating that it would provide benefits for investors, regulators, and issuers. <sup>231</sup> One commenter specifically supported requiring the Inline XBRL format over allowing reporting entities to choose from more than one data standard or developing a custom schema for the required information. <sup>232</sup> After considering public comments received, and because we continue to believe that it would allow investors, other market participants, and other data users to automate their use of this information, we are adopting this requirement as proposed.

The Commission did not propose to require affected funds to tag the table on the form’s cover page that includes information about calculation of the fund’s registrationfee under the Securities Act. <sup>233</sup> One commenter recommended that the Commission require tagging of such registration fee information, stating that these are valuable data elements and that extending the requirement to fee information would not increase theburden of tagging on issuers. <sup>234</sup> The Commission recently proposed such amendments to Form N-2 as part of a larger proposal to modernize the filing fee disclosure and payment methods for most of the Commission’s fee-bearing forms, statements, and relatedrules. <sup>235</sup> As a result, we believe that the filing fee disclosure and payment modernization rulemaking is a more appropriate vehicle for considering whether the fee calculation information on Form N-2 should be tagged.

In addition, we are amending Form N-2 to add new check boxes to its cover page, as proposed. <sup>236</sup> We proposed several new check boxes to allow investors, Commission staff, and others to more readily identify types of issuers and securities. <sup>237</sup> We continue to believe that this check box information will allow investors, Commission staff, and othersto more readily identify types of issuers and securities, and so are adopting this provision as proposed. <sup>238</sup> These check boxes will be among the data points required to be tagged using Inline XBRL format. <sup>239</sup>

<h>c. Tagging of Prospectus Disclosure Items</h>

We are adopting, as proposed, a requirement that all affected funds tag certain information that is required to be included in an affected fund’s prospectus using Inline XBRL format. All affected funds will be required to submit certain information in registration statements or post-effective amendments filed on Form N-2 and certain forms of prospectuses filed pursuant to rule <sup>424</sup> under the Securities Act to the Commission using Inline XBRL. <sup>240</sup> A seasoned fund filing a short-form registration statement on Form N-2 also will be required to tag information appearing in Exchange Act reports— such as those on Form N-CSR, 10-K, 10-Q, or 8-K—if that information is required to be tagged in the fund’s prospectus . <sup>241</sup>

We will require affected funds to tag the following prospectus disclosure items using Inline XBRL format: Fee Table; Senior Securities Table; Investment Objectives and Policies; Risk Factors; Share Price Data; and Capital Stock, Long-Term Debt, and Other Securities. <sup>242</sup> We continue to believe that these items are of greatest utility for

5. Dividend Reinvestment Plans” to Form N-2. See Dechert Comment Letter; IPA Comment Letter. The new check box will not affect that ability.investors and other data users that seek structured data to analyze and compare funds, as they provide important information about a fund’s key features, costs, and risks. <sup>243</sup> We believe tagging the Fee Table, which provides detailed information about the fund’s costs, could facilitate analysis of fund costs and allow investors and other data users to compare the costs of a particular affected fund to the costs of other funds or other investment products, such as mutual funds. The Senior Securities Table requires registrants to include information about each class of senior securities, including bank loans. Tagging this information will facilitate analyses of outstanding senior securities that may bear on the likelihood, frequency, and size of distributions from the fund to itsinvestors. Tagging Investment Objectives and Policies, which provides information about the fund’s principal portfolio emphasis, will help an investor determine the degree to which a fund’s objectives and policies align with the investor’s preferences. Risk Factors describes risks associated with an investment in the fund. Tagging Risk Factors will facilitate the aggregation, analysis, and comparison by investors and other data users of information about a fund’s risks alongside the fund’s features and benefits. Tagging Share Price Information is important because the presence of a premium or discount may bear on the likelihood, frequency, and size of distributions from the fund to its investors, which we believe may be of particular importance to many affected fund investors.

Tagging Capital Stock, Long-Term Debt, and Other Securities better informs commonamended Form N-2. This information largely parallels similar information contained in the Form N-1A risk/return summary. See Item 2 (Risk/Return Summary: Investment Objectives/Goals), Item 3 (Risk/Return Summary: Fee Table), and Item 4 (Risk/Return Summary: Investments, Risks and Performance) of Form N-1A.shareholders how their rights, expenses, and risks are affected when the fund issues other types or classes of securities. We also continue to believe that these items are best suited to being tagged in a structured format.

The commenters who addressed the proposed requirement supported it. <sup>244</sup> These commenters stated that the tagged data would be useful, including both numeric and narrative information. <sup>245</sup> In addition, one commenter asserted that the Commissionshould require tagging all financial data that is required to be reported. <sup>246</sup> We believe that this rule is appropriately focused on the key items that are most suitable for tagging and of greatest utility for investors.

Because we continue to believe that structuring these data elements will allow investors, other market participants, and other data users to automate their use of this information, we are adopting this requirement as proposed. <sup>247</sup> As with other new Commission XBRL taxonomies, staff will post for public review and feedback a draft Inline XBRL taxonomy for affected funds’ tagged prospectus disclosures. <sup>248</sup> Whenavailable, affected funds will be required to use the most recent version of the Inline XBRL taxonomy for tagged prospectus disclosures, as specified by the EDGAR Filer Manual. <sup>249</sup>

As the Commission proposed, and as required of mutual funds and ETFs under the recently adopted Inline XBRL regime , <sup>250</sup> we will require affected funds to submit “Interactive Data Files” ( i.e. , machine-readable computer code that presents information in XBRL format) <sup>251</sup> as follows:for any registration statements and post-effective amendments, Interactive Data Files must be filed either concurrently with the filing or in a subsequent amendment that is filed on or before the date that the registration statement or post-effective amendment that contains the related information becomeseffective; <sup>252</sup>for any form of prospectus filed pursuant to rule 424, Interactive Data Files must be submitted concurrently with the filing; <sup>253</sup> andfor any Exchange Act reports that a seasoned fund filing a short-form registration statement on Form N-2 will have to tag, as discussed above, Interactive Data files must be submitted concurrently with the filing. <sup>254</sup>

We proposed this approach to facilitate timely availability and promote the comparability and utility of important information in a structured data format for investors, other market participants, and other data users, which we believed would yield substantial benefits. <sup>255</sup> We did not receive comments on this aspect of the proposal. We continue to believe that this approach will yield the substantial benefits discussed above and therefore are adopting it as proposed.

<h>d. Structured Data Format for Form 24F-2</h>

We will require submission of filings on Form 24F-2 in a structured XML format. <sup>256</sup> We proposed this use of a structured data format, believing that it would make it easier for issuers to accurately prepare and submit the information required by Form 24F-2 and would make the submitted information more useful to Commission staff. <sup>257</sup> The commenters who addressed the proposed requirement to structure Form 24F-2supported it, <sup>258</sup> with one commenter observing that the structured registration fee information could be useful in validating the submission. <sup>259</sup> Commenters were mixed on the proposed custom XML format, with one commenter supporting the proposed XML format , <sup>260</sup> and another recommending that the Commission use an XBRL formatinstead. <sup>261</sup>

Because Form 24F-2 is primarily used by Commission staff to validate registration fees paid by issuers and not for financial reporting purposes, we continue to believe that a custom XML schema will be an appropriate format for the required information. For example, while XBRL allows issuers to capture the rich complexity of financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, we believe that XML is more appropriate for the relatively simple characteristics of the fund’s fee information inwould best be taken up on a separate, holistic basis, for BDCs and operating companies alike, rather than in the context of this final rule.reports on Form 24F-2. <sup>262</sup> In addition we continue to believe that the XML format will improve the quality of information disclosed by providing a built-in validation framework of the data in the reports. <sup>263</sup> We therefore will require reports on Form 24F-2 to be filed in a structured XML format, as proposed.

<h>2. Periodic Reporting Requirements</h>

We are also adopting new annual report requirements, as proposed. As we discussed in the Proposing Release, we expect several of the reforms we are adopting in this release, such as those relating to automatically effective shelf registration, forward incorporation by reference, and final prospectus delivery, will elevate the importance of periodic reporting relative to prospectus disclosure for affected funds.

A seasoned fund filing a short-form registration statement on Form N-2 will be required to forward incorporate all periodic Exchange Act reports into its registration statement. <sup>264</sup> This should result in periodic reports becoming a more salient, convenient, and comprehensive source of updated information about a particular seasoned fund,relative to that fund’s registration statement. As a result, these funds’ annual reports may take on greater prominence, with investors looking to the annual reports for key information. <sup>265</sup> Registered CEFs’ shareholder reports may also take on greaterprominence for investors because, under the final rule, affected funds will not be required to deliver final prospectuses but will still be required to deliver shareholder reports atleast semi-annually. <sup>266</sup>

Accordingly, as proposed, we are requiring seasoned funds that register using the proposed short-form registration instruction to include key information in their annual reports regarding fees and expenses, premiums and discounts, and outstanding seniorsecurities that the funds currently disclose in their prospectuses. <sup>267</sup> Because the annual report will be incorporated by reference into the fund’s prospectus, requiring disclosure in both the prospectus and annual report should not require duplicative disclosure.

Moreover, specifying identical disclosure requirements in both places may facilitate forward incorporation by reference, by making clear that the same required disclosure will satisfy both requirements. We continue to believe that investors should have no less current information than they do today about these items when the fund is offering its shares. <sup>268</sup> Finally, we are requiring, as proposed, registered CEFs to provide management’s discussion of fund performance (or “MDFP”) in their annual reports to shareholders, BDCs to provide financial highlights in their registration statements and annual reports, and affected funds filing a short-form registration statement on Form N-2to disclose material unresolved staff comments. <sup>269</sup> These provisions are intended to modernize and harmonize our periodic report disclosure requirements for affected funds with those applicable to operating companies and mutual funds and ETFs. <sup>270</sup>

<h>a. Fee and Expense Table, Share Price Data, and Senior Securities Table</h>

We are adopting a requirement, as proposed, that funds filing a short-form registration statement on Form N-2 include key information in their annual reports that they disclose in their prospectuses in light of the importance of this information and the increased prominence of shareholder reports under our final rule. Specifically, we will require that these funds include the following information in their annual reports: <sup>271</sup>

Fee and Expense Table : Form N-2 requires registrants to include information about the costs and expenses that the investor will bear directly or indirectly, using specified captions and a specified tabular format. <sup>272</sup> This table is designed to help investors understand the costs of investing in an affected fund and to compare those costs with the costs of other affected funds. <sup>273</sup> The Commissionhas previously noted the importance of costs to an investment decision and, in the case of registered open-end funds, has specified the location of the fee table to enhance the prominence of the cost information. <sup>274</sup>

Share Price Data : Form N-2 requires registrants to include information about the share price of the registrant’s stock as well as information about any premium or discount that the share price reflects, compared to the registrant’s NAV. <sup>275</sup> The presence of a premium or discount may bear on the likelihood, frequency, and size of distributions from the fund to its investors, which we believe may be of particular importance to many affected fund investors.

Senior Securities Table : Form N-2 requires registrants to include information about each of its classes of senior securities, including bank loans. <sup>276</sup> As with a premium or discount, any outstanding senior securities may bear on the likelihood, frequency, and size of distributions from the fund to its investors. Aregistrant must disclose information about its senior securities for the most recent ten years, the last five years of which must be audited. <sup>277</sup>

The commenters that addressed these proposed requirements related to the Fee and Expense Table, Share Price Data, and Senior Securities Table supported them. <sup>278</sup> Because we continue to believe in the importance of this information and the increased prominence of shareholder reports under our final rule, <sup>279</sup> we are adopting this aspect of the proposal as proposed. <sup>280</sup>

With respect to the Senior Securities Table, two commenters requested that we revise the instruction to Form N-2 as it relates to affected funds to reduce the audit requirement from the last five-years (in the registration statement) to the same periods as contained in the audited balance sheet presented in the annual report. <sup>281</sup> However, such achange would alter the periods presented for the Senior Securities Table, which match thewould not always satisfy the requirements of Item 8.6.a. For example, Item 8.6.a of Form N-2 requires certain information about each portfolio company, such as the percentage of each class owned by the issuer, the issuer’s relationship with the portfolio company, and the address of the portfolio company. Regulation S-X requires no such disclosures.periods presented in the Financial Highlights. <sup>282</sup> Given the importance of asset coverage and the comparability of information contained in both the Financial Highlights and the Senior Securities Table, we do not believe such a change is appropriate. Additionally, because the annual report will be incorporated by reference into the fund’s prospectus, filing the audited senior securities table in the annual report will not result in duplicative disclosure. For this reason, we have determined not to amend the requirements in the manner suggested by the commenters.

<h>b. Management’s Discussion of Fund Performance</h>

We are also adopting, as proposed, an amendment to Form N-2 that will extend the MDFP disclosure requirements to all registered CEFs. <sup>283</sup> Currently, mutual funds and ETFs are required to include MDFP in their annual reports to shareholders . <sup>284</sup> MDFP disclosure aids investors in assessing a fund’s performance over the prior year and complements other backward looking information required in the annual report, such as financial statements. <sup>285</sup> This required disclosure is grounded conceptually in the disclosure requirement for operating companies (as well as BDCs) to include a narrative discussion of the financial statements of the company—“management discussion andanalysis” or “MD&A”—and to provide an opportunity to look at a company “through the eyes of management.” <sup>286</sup>

We proposed to amend Form N-2 to extend the MDFP disclosure requirements to all registered CEFs. <sup>287</sup> Specifically, we proposed to require that registered CEFs:

Discuss the factors that materially affected their performance during the most recently completed fiscal year, including the relevant market conditions and the investment strategies and techniques used by the fund;

Provide a line graph comparing the initial and subsequent account values at the end of each of the most recently completed ten fiscal years of the fund and a table of the fund’s total returns for the 1-, 5-, and 10-year periods as of the last day of the fund’s most recent fiscal year; and

Discuss the effect of any policy or practice of maintaining a specified level of distributions to shareholders on the fund’s investment strategies and per share NAV during the last fiscal year, as well as the extent to which the registrant’s distribution policy resulted in distributions of capital.

Commenters that addressed this aspect of the proposal supported it. <sup>288</sup> Because we continue to believe that investors in these funds—like investors in mutual funds,

ETFs, BDCs, and operating companies—would benefit from annual report disclosure that aids them in assessing the fund’s performance over the prior year and that complements other information in the repor t , <sup>289</sup> we are adopting this requirement as proposed. <sup>290</sup>

<h>c. Financial Highlights</h>

We are amending Form N-2, as proposed, to require that a BDC, like other affected funds, include financial highlights disclosure summarizing its financial statements in its registration statement and annual report. <sup>291</sup> Today, BDCs include their full financial statements in their prospectus, and we currently permit BDCs to omit financial highlights disclosure summarizing these financial statements. <sup>292</sup> We understand, however, that it is generally market practice for BDCs to include financial highlights disclosure. This information is arranged to allow investors to trace the operating performance of a fund on a per share basis from the fund’s beginning NAV to its ending NAV so that investors may understand the sources of changes. <sup>293</sup> It summarizes the

Proposing Release, supra footnote <sup>10</sup> , at section II.H.2.b. A few commenters expressly opposed this change to the proposed requirement compared with the MDFP requirement in Form N-1A. ABA Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; Invesco Comment Letter; TIAA Comment Letter.financial statements. <sup>294</sup> Commenters did not address this aspect of the proposal. Because we continue to believe that investors will benefit from required disclosure summarizing a BDC’s financial statements, <sup>295</sup> we are adopting this change as proposed. <sup>296</sup>

<h>d. Unresolved Staff Comments</h>

We are also adopting, as proposed, a requirement that affected funds filing a short-form registration statement disclose outstanding staff comments that remain unresolved for a substantial period of time and that the fund believes are material. <sup>297</sup> As part of the Commission’s <sup>2005</sup> securities offering reforms for operating companies, the Commission adopted a similar provision for operating companies, recognizing that the new rules could eliminate some incentives issuers may have to timely resolve any staff

In addition, we are adopting, as proposed, a conforming change to the financial highlights requirements to eliminate the current requirement that registered CEFs specify the average commission rate paid. See Item 4.1 of amended Form N-2 (removing Instructions 18-19 from Item 4.1). Although this information is currently required for registered CEFs, the Commission previously eliminated a similar requirement from Item 13(a) of Form N-1A for open-end funds registered on Form N-1A. Item 4.1.l of Form N-2; Instructions 18–19 to Item 4.1 of Form N-2; Item 13(a) of Form N-1A; See Registration Form Used by Open-End Management Investment Companies, Investment Company Act Release No. 23064 (Mar. 13, 1998) [63 FR 13916, 13936 (Mar. 23, 1998)]. The

Commission reached this determination after receiving and considering public comment arguing that these rates are technical information that typical investors are unable to understand. Id. We continue to believe that the same considerations supporting elimination of this requirement from Form N-1A also apply to registered CEFs.comments on their Exchange Act reports. <sup>298</sup> The Commission observed, in connection with this proposed requirement, that this rulemaking similarly may eliminate some incentives for certain affected funds to timely resolve staff comments.

Two commenters recommended that the Commission not adopt this proposed requirement. <sup>299</sup> One commenter stated that the proposed requirement would be inconsistent with Commission efforts to simplify disclosure and focus on key information important to investors. <sup>300</sup> We believe, however, that, because the requirement only relates to comments that the issuer believes are material and because they will relate to information about which the issuer and the Commission staff disagree, the disclosure of the comments is likely to be information that is important to investors. This commenter also stated that the requirement would be at odds with recent statements about the non- binding nature of staff guidance. However, the provision will not make the substance of statements by staff in their comments binding upon the public or the Commission.

Rather, the Commission, by rule, will require affected funds to inform investors about their disagreements with the staff in connection with the staff’s review of disclosures.

Two commenters expressed concern that differing views about whether aparticular comment is “material” or “unresolved” could result in inconsistent disclosure among different funds in similar circumstances. <sup>301</sup> We recognize that analysis of whether a particular written comment must be disclosed may involve some subjective judgmentregarding specific facts and circumstances. Many disclosure requirements inherently involve some subjective judgment and can result in some variance in the disclosure provided by different funds.

These commenters also suggested some alternatives to the proposed requirement.

For example, one commenter suggested that the Commission, rather than require disclosure of material unresolved staff comments, issue a stop order to prevent an offering from going forward if necessary. <sup>302</sup> We believe that it is more appropriate to preserve an intermediate approach for the Commission, in appropriate circumstances, to allow an offering to proceed while informing investors and others about materialdisagreements between the issuer and the Commission’s staff, so that investors can make an informed judgment about the disagreement. Another commenter recommended, as an alternative, that the Commission publish its staff’s comments and issuer responses. <sup>303</sup> We believe, however, that investors and other interested persons are more likely to see and read disclosure of material, unresolved staff comments if they appear in a fund’s annual report than comments and responses published separately. <sup>304</sup>disseminates using the EDGAR system, may also inform investors and the market about comments that are promptly resolved. See Press Release No. 2004-89; SEC Staff to Publicly Release Comment Letters and Responses (June 24, 2004) available at https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2004-89.htm .

In addition, this requirement parallels the current requirement for operating companies that use the offering rules. <sup>305</sup> These commenters, however, provide no basis for distinguishing affected funds from those operating companies that are already subject to the requirement. After considering comments received, and because we continue tobelieve that these disclosure requirements will provide an incentive for affected funds to timely resolve staff comments and that investors may value information about areas of disagreement that the issuer believes are material, we are adopting the requirement as proposed. <sup>306</sup>

<h>3. Current Reporting Requirements for Affected Funds</h>

As discussed in the Proposing Release, operating companies and BDCs are required to promptly report certain events on Form 8-K, while registered CEFs generally are not required to report on Form 8-K. The Commission proposed to require registered CEFs to report information on Form 8-K to enhance parity with operating companies and BDCs, to improve information for investors and the market, and to recognize the role of Form 8-K reporting in the <sup>2005</sup> offering reform amendments. <sup>307</sup> It also proposed to amend Form 8-K to: (1) add two new reporting items for affected funds on materialchanges to investment objectives or policies and material write-downs of significant investments, and (2) adapt the existing reporting requirements and instructions to affected funds. As discussed in more detail below, in response to comments, we are not adopting the proposed Form 8-K amendments. <sup>308</sup> However, we will continue to consider current reporting more generally as part of our ongoing review of the effectiveness of investment company disclosure.

<h>a. Form 8-K Reporting for Registered CEFs</h>

The Commission proposed to require registered CEFs that are reporting companies under section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act to report current information on Form 8-K. Commenters generally opposed a Form 8-K reporting requirement for registered CEFs. <sup>309</sup> Commenters suggested that registered CEFs should not be subject to Form 8-K reporting requirements because the commenters believe that:

<h>1. existing registered CEF disclosure is sufficient; (2) Form 8-K reporting would be costly for registered CEFs; (3) parity with operating companies and BDCs isunnecessary in the context of Form 8-K reporting; <sup>312</sup> and (4) investors, analysts, and regulators have not previously indicated that registered CEF disclosure is inadequate . <sup>313</sup></h>

With respect to existing disclosure practices, commenters stated that registered CEFs already provide material updates through other required or voluntary mechanisms ( e.g. , prospectus supplements, press releases, shareholder reports, voluntary Form 8-K filings, and website disclosure) that result in adequate and timely disclosure of information to investors . <sup>314</sup> One commenter suggested that registered CEFs would be unlikely to provide meaningful new information under Form 8-K beyond what they already disclose under other regulatory requirements. <sup>315</sup> Two commenters expressed concern that Form 8-K reporting may not timely inform investors about important fund events. <sup>316</sup> One of these commenters suggested that fund investors are more likely toreceive timely information through a registered CEF’s typical practice of issuing a press release about an important event, posting the press release to its website, and including information about the event in its next shareholder report. <sup>317</sup>

Although they opposed a new Form 8-K reporting requirement, a few commenters suggested alternative approaches if we were to require registered CEFs to report on Form 8-K. One commenter suggested that, if the Commission requires registered CEFs to report on Form 8-K, we should require them to report only a subset of Form 8-K items. <sup>318</sup> Another commenter suggested that, rather than require registered CEFs to report on Form 8-K, we could require listed registered CEFs to file press releases containing material information on Form 8-K, similar to how continuously-offered registered CEFs file prospectus supplements on EDGAR. <sup>319</sup> Additionally, one commenter suggested that we require registered CEFs to more directly notify investors about material fund changes and stated that Form 8-K filings would not provide appropriate notice to a fund’s investors. <sup>320</sup>

As we recognized in the Proposing Release and as noted by commenters, there are differences between the types of events that are important to registered CEFs and the types of events that are important to operating companies. <sup>321</sup> Moreover, for those Form 8-

K events that would be relevant to registered CEFs, we recognize that these funds currently may disclose substantially similar information through other mechanisms, such as prospectus supplements, post-effective amendments, and press releases. We also are sensitive to commenters’ concerns about the burdens to registered CEFs associated with a new Form 8-K reporting requirement, particularly for those registered CEFs that will not qualify as WKSIs or be eligible to file short-form registration statements under the amendments we are adopting.

As a result of these considerations, we are persuaded that a new Form 8-K reporting requirement for registered CEFs may not substantially improve the flow of important current information to investors and the market and, as a result, would not justify the additional burdens associated with Form 8-K reporting. Therefore, we are not adopting the proposed Form 8-K reporting requirements for registered CEFs. <sup>322</sup> However, we will continue to consider whether more current reporting requirements that are tailored to registered CEFs, or to registered investment companies more generally, may be appropriate in connection with our continuing review of investment company disclosure effectiveness. <sup>323</sup>

Although registered CEFs generally will not be required to file reports on Form 8- K, a registered CEF that is eligible to file a short-form registration statement may voluntarily file information on Form 8-K to forward incorporate that information into itsfootnote <sup>313</sup> .registration statement or for other purposes ( e.g. , to publicly disseminate information under exchange rules, as applicable). <sup>324</sup> These voluntary Form 8-K filings will not affect a registered CEF’s ability to qualify as a seasoned fund. This is because the requirements to be current and timely with respect to the fund’s Exchange Act and Investment Company Act reports only apply to materials a fund is required to file. <sup>325</sup>

<h>b. Other Proposed Amendments to Form 8-K</h>

We are similarly not adopting the other proposed amendments to Form 8-K, including the two proposed reporting items regarding material changes to investment objectives or policies and material write-downs. <sup>326</sup> Although the two proposed reporting items also would have applied to BDCs, we are not adopting these current reporting requirements for any affected funds. Commenters generally opposed these proposedreporting items and argued that existing disclosure is adequate. <sup>327</sup> We will continue to consider the adequacy of affected fund disclosure, including the availability and timeliness of information about material changes in investment objectives or policies and material write-downs of significant investments, as part of our ongoing review of the effectiveness of investment company disclosure. <sup>328</sup> Rather than establish new current reporting requirements for affected funds on a piecemeal basis in this release, we believe it is more appropriate to consider current reporting in connection with a broader,systematic review of investment company disclosure.

<h>4. Online Availability of Information Incorporated by Reference</h>

We are adopting, as proposed, amendments to Form N-2’s General Instruction for Incorporation by Reference. <sup>329</sup> All registered CEFs and BDCs currently can backward incorporate their financial information from previously-filed Exchange Act reports into the prospectus or SAI. However, Form N–2 currently requires that a fund provide to new purchasers a copy of all previously-filed materials that the fund incorporated by reference into the prospectus and/or SAI. <sup>330</sup> Under the amendments, and as proposed, we are removing the requirement that a fund deliver to new investors information that it hasincorporated by reference into the prospectus or SAI. <sup>331</sup> These amendments will allow the fund to make its prospectus, SAI, and the incorporated materials readily available and accessible on a website identified in the fund’s prospectus and SAI. <sup>332</sup> Affected fundswill also be required to provide incorporated materials upon request free of charge. We believe this approach will improve the online accessibility of the prospectus and SAI and any documents that are incorporated by reference for investors that wish to review such information online, and will facilitate the efficient use of incorporation by reference byaffected funds. <sup>333</sup> The only commenter who addressed this approach supported it, <sup>334</sup> and we are adopting it as proposed.

<h>5. Amendments to Certain Registered CEFs’ Annual Report</h>

Disclosure

We are adopting, largely as proposed, amendments to rule 8b-16(b) that are designed to allow investors in registered CEFs that rely on the rule to more easily identifywhich largely mirrors the disclosure requirements in Item 12(c) of Form S-3. The newinstruction streamlines—but does not substantively change (other than the website disclosure provision discussed below) — the disclosure requirements for incorporation by reference in current Form N-2.without charge, a copy of the incorporated materials on request, to new General

Instruction F.4.b of amended Form N-2. We also are conforming certain incorporation by reference provisions in Form N-2 to mirror parallel provisions in Form N-1A. See new General Instruction F.2.a–c of amended Form N-2; cf . General Instruction D.1.(a)-(c) of Form N-1A.and understand key information about their investments. <sup>335</sup> Although rule 8b-16(a) generally requires registered investment companies to update their registration statements annually, rule 8b-16(b) currently allows registered CEFs to forgo an annual update provided that they disclose in their annual reports certain key changes that have occurred during the prior year. <sup>336</sup> Disclosures that describe a specific change to a fund strategy or risk may not have sufficient context to allow investors to understand the effect of such change, potentially leaving shareholders to have to look at a series of documents—from the fund’s prospectus, which could be several years old, plus each subsequent annual report—to understand certain key information about the fund, such as its current investment strategy or principal risk factors. <sup>337</sup> Accordingly, we proposed to require funds that rely on rule 8b-16(b) to describe any changes in enough detail to allow investors to understand each change and how it may affect the fund. <sup>338</sup> For example, as stated in the Proposing Release, to the extent a fund’s principal investment objectives,investment policies or principal risks have changed, the fund should describe its objectives, policies or risks before and after the change. <sup>339</sup>

The one commenter to address this aspect of the proposal stated that a closed-end fund’s annual report should include a full description of the fund’s current objectives, strategies and risks, as many closed-end funds do not maintain a current registration statement, which would otherwise include this information. <sup>340</sup> One commenter described difficulties faced by investors in determining an affected fund’s current investment objectives and policies, with another requesting a single location where such key information could be found. <sup>341</sup>

As proposed, we are requiring funds that rely on rule 8b-16(b) to describe certain key changes in enough detail to allow investors to understand each change and how it may affect the fund. <sup>342</sup> We believe that in giving context for a change to one or more of

The Proposing Release requested comment on whether we should adopt different disclosure requirements for funds that rely on rule 8b-16, including whether we should require such funds to summarize in their annual reports certain key information thatwould be required in a current prospectus. See Proposing Release, supra footnote 10, at section II.H.5.the required disclosures, it is particularly effective for a fund to describe current information regarding related disclosures, as this approach may facilitate a more complete understanding of how a change to one aspect of the fund impacts the fund more broadly. Such disclosures must be prefaced with a legend clarifying that the disclosures provide only a summary of certain changes that have occurred in the past year, whichmay not reflect all of the changes that have occurred since the investor purchased the fund. <sup>343</sup>

In response to comments and in a change from the proposal, we also are requiringany affected fund that relies on rule 8b-16(b) to describe the fund’s current investment objectives, investment policies, and principal risks in its annual report. <sup>344</sup> These key disclosures must be provided, even if there were no changes in the past year. This will ensure that investors can access in a single location current information about key aspects of the fund in which they invest. We believe that funds could increase the effectiveness of this disclosure by presenting it concisely, in accordance with “plain English” principles for organization, wording, and design. We similarly encourage funds to tailor their disclosures to how the fund operates rather than rely on generic, standard disclosures about the fund’s investment policies and risks. Finally, we encourage funds to describe principal risks in order of importance, with most significant risks appearing first ( i.e., not listing risks in alphabetical order).

<h>J. Effe ctive and Compliance Dates</h>

Effective Dates . The final rule will become effective on August 1, 2020. While we proposed that the rule would become effective <sup>60</sup> days from publication in the Federal Register, we are establishing a fixed date so that the amendments to certain rules and forms adopted pursuant to the Variable Contract Summary Prospectus Adopting Release will be effective prior to the amendments to the same rules and forms adopted herein . <sup>345</sup> The August 1, <sup>2020</sup> effective date will apply to all aspects of the final rule, except for the following:

Rules 23c-3, 24f-2, and Form 24F-2 . The amendments to rules 23c-3, 24f-2, and Form 24F-2 <sup>346</sup> will become effective August 1, <sup>2021</sup> (one year after other aspects of the final rule take effect, as proposed). One commenter suggested making the amendments to rules 23c-3 and 24f-2 immediately effective for new intervalfunds so they can pay registration fees based on the net issuance of shares sold during their initial fiscal year, and allow existing funds to use the new payment method as soon as possible thereafter. <sup>347</sup> While we agree that interval funds should be able to calculate fees on Form 24F-2 as soon as possible, as proposed, the amendments to rules 23c-3 and 24f-2 will become effective one year after thefinal rule’s effective date to provide sufficient time to modify the Commission’s systems to accept such filings from interval funds. <sup>348</sup>

Rules <sup>456</sup> and <sup>457</sup> and Forms S-1, S-3, F-1 and F-3: The amendments torules 456 and 457 and Forms S-1, S-3, F-1 and F-3 under the Securities Act will become effective August 1, 2021.

Compliance Dates . We are adopting compliance dates for certain new requirements to provide a transition period after the effective date of the final rule.

MDFP . As proposed, an annual report filed by a registered CEF one year or more after the effective date of the final rule will be required to include the MDFP disclosures. <sup>349</sup> We received no comments on this proposed compliance period. Affected funds must comply with this requirement by August 1, 2021.

Structured Data Requirements (Financial Statement, Cover Page, and Prospectus Information) . We proposed that all affected funds subject to the Inline XBRL structured data reporting requirements for financial statement, registration statement cover page, and prospectus information that are eligible to file a short-form registration statement would be required to comply with those provisions 18 months after the effective date, and all other affected funds to comply 24 months after the effective date. The one commenter who addressed this aspect of therelease recommended that any new Inline XBRL requirements have a compliancedate later than that required for open-end funds. <sup>350</sup> We are extending the compliance period by an additional six months to align more closely with the Inline XBRL compliance periods for other fund registrants. <sup>351</sup> Accordingly,affected funds that are eligible to file a short-form registration statement will be required to comply with those provisions <sup>24</sup> months after the effective date, or August 1, 2022. All other affected funds subject to these requirements must comply <sup>30</sup> months after the effective date, or February 1, 2023. Affected funds will be permitted to file in Inline XBRL prior to the compliance date once EDGAR has been modified to accept submissions in Inline XBRL for all forms subject to the amendments, which is anticipated to be March 2021. Notice of EDGAR system readiness to accept filings in Inline XBRL will be provided in a manner similar to notices of taxonomy updates and EDGAR Filer Manual updates.

Structured Data Requirements (Form 24F-2 ). As proposed, all filers on

Form 24F-2 (including existing Form 24F-2 filers, such as open-end funds and unit investment trusts, as well as interval funds) will be required to file reports on the form in an XML structured data format <sup>18</sup> months after the effective date, or

<h>III. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS</h>

We are adopting amendments to our rules designed to carry out the requirements of section <sup>803</sup> of the BDC Act and section <sup>509</sup> of the Registered CEF Act and tailor the disclosure and regulatory framework for affected funds in light of the amendments to the offering rules applicable to them. Currently, affected funds face regulatory impediments to capital formation as they are not able to use the flexible and less costly offering process that operating companies use when conducting registered securities offerings.

This may hinder affected funds’ ability to raise capital, take advantage of favorablemarket conditions as operating companies do, and enjoy lower cost of capital and lower offering costs. Additionally, because of existing rules, affected funds generally are unable to communicate about an offering before a registration statement is filed, and their post- filing communications are subject to prospectus liability under section 12 of the

Securities Act (or must be accompanied or preceded by the statutory prospectus). The final rule will provide incremental flexibility to funds in their communications, which may increase the flow of information to investors. As discussed in detail above, the final rule will affect numerous distinct aspects of how our securities offering and communications rules apply to affected funds. <sup>354</sup>

<h>A. Introduction and Baseline</h>

We are sensitive to the economic effects that may result from the final rule, including the benefits, costs, and the effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act, section 2(b) of the Securities Act, and section 2(c) of the Investment Company Act state that when engaging in rulemaking that requires us to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in (or, with respect to the Investment Company Act, consistent with) the public interest, we must consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Additiona lly, section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires us, when making rules or regulations under the Exchange Act, to consider, among other matters, the impact that any such rule or regulation would have on competition and states that the Commission shall not adopt any such rule or regulation which would impose a burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Exchange Act.

We have considered the potential costs and benefits that would result from the final rule, as well as the potential effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Many of the potential economic effects of the final rule would stem from the statutory mandates, while others would stem from the discretion we are exercising. We discuss the potential economic effects of the amendments to implement the statutory mandates in sections III.B and III.C. We considered certain alternatives to our approach to implementing the statutory mandates, as discussed in section III.D. We are also adopting certain other amendments to tailor affected funds’ disclosure and regulatory framework. We discuss the potential economic effects of these discretionaryamendments, as well as reasonable alternatives to these provisions, in section III.E.

Where possible, we have attempted to quantify the costs, benefits, and effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation expected to result from the final rule. In some cases, however, we are unable to quantify the economic effects because we lack the information necessary to provide a reasonable and reliable estimate.

The baseline we use to analyze the potential effects of the final rule is the current set of legal requirements and market practices. The final rule likely will have a significant impact on the security offering requirements and disclosure practices of affected funds.

The overall magnitude of the benefits and the costs associated with the final rule will depend on many factors, including the number of affected funds that rely on the final rule. We recognize that some affected funds would not satisfy the conditions in certain of the amendments ( e.g. , those limited to WKSIs or funds that file a short-form registration statement on Form N-2), and other affected funds may satisfy the conditions but choose not to rely on the final rule. The discussion below describes our understanding of the markets and issuers that will be affected by the final rule.

<h>1. Number of Affected Funds</h>

The final rule will affect BDCs and registered CEFs. As of June 30, 2019, there were <sup>791</sup> affected funds, including <sup>105</sup> BDCs and <sup>686</sup> registered CEFs. To estimate the number of BDCs, we use data from Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings as of June 30, 2019, the latest data available . <sup>355</sup> We identify <sup>51</sup> listed BDCs and <sup>54</sup> unlisted BDCs. Theaverage net assets of the listed BDCs is approximately $820 million, and the average of their total assets is $1.5 billion. Based on trading data as of June 30, 2019, 44 of the listed BDCs have public float greater than $75 million ( i.e. , one of the transaction requirement thresholds for primary offerings under the short-form registration instruction) and <sup>15</sup> of those BDCs have public float greater than $700 million ( i.e. , the WKSI public float threshold). <sup>356</sup>

We use data from Morningstar and SEC filings to estimate the number ofregistered CEFs . <sup>357</sup> We identify <sup>497</sup> registered CEFs that were listed on an exchange as of June 30, 2019, including <sup>1</sup> interval fund. There were <sup>189</sup> unlisted registered CEFs as of June 30, 2019, including 60 interval funds. The average net assets of the listedregistered CEFs is approximately $551 million, while the average net assets of the unlisted registered CEFs is approximately $382 million. <sup>358</sup> Based on trading data as of June 30, 2019, <sup>455</sup> of the listed registered CEFs have public float greater than $75million, and 85 of those funds have public float greater than $700 million. <sup>359</sup> Information about the types of offerings conducted by different categories of affected funds for the period of July 1, <sup>2014</sup> – June 30, 2019 is reflected in the below table. <sup>360</sup>

T A BLE 3

As of September 2019, there were 7,995 mutual funds, 2,076 ETFs, and 4,758 UITs. Thus, together with the <sup>791</sup> affected funds, there is a total of 15,620 funds, affected and non-affected. This means that affected funds represent about 5.1% of the totalnumber of funds. As of September 2019, mutual funds had approximately $20,156 billion in assets, ETFs had approximately $4,024 billion in assets, UITs had approximately $76 billion in assets, and affected funds had approximately $459 billion in assets. Thus, affected funds represent about 1.8% of total investment company assets.

We use data from Morningstar and SEC filings to estimate the number of affected ETPs. We identify 68 such ETPs as of December 31, 2019.

<h>2. Current Securities Offering Requirements for Affected Funds</h>

The securities offering process for affected funds at present differs from that for operating companies. Affected funds register their securities offerings on Form N-2, while operating companies use other forms ( e.g. , Form S-1 or Form S-3). As discussed in more detail above in sections II.B , II.C , and II.F , registered investment companies and BDCs are excluded from certain offering and communications rules available to operating companies.

Affected funds currently are expressly excluded from the WKSI definition. As aresult, even if they would otherwise meet the WKSI definition, they are unable to, for example, file an automatic shelf registration statement or communicate about an offering before filing a registration statement. <sup>361</sup>

Affected funds currently can conduct shelf offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(x) if they meet the applicable eligibility criteria for Form S-3, even though affected fundsregister their securities offerings on Form N-2. Affected funds conducting shelf offerings,however, currently experience certain burdens not faced by operating companies. <sup>362</sup> For example, affected funds conducting shelf offerings currently must file post-effective amendments to make certain updates to their registration statements, while operating companies conducting shelf offerings may update their registration statements through forward incorporation by reference. As a result, affected funds can incur additionalexpense or delay for shelf offerings, which can affect the timing of their capital-raising. Similarly, different rules apply to affected fund communications as opposed to operating company communications. <sup>363</sup> These differences can impose additional costs or constraints on affected funds or others because, for example, underwriters may be more familiar with the operating company rules. Further, affected funds currently are required to deliver a final prospectus to investors. <sup>364</sup> Final prospectuses can be lengthy, particularly for BDCs because they generally do not take advantage of backward incorporation by reference currently permitted for certain financial and relatedinformation. For example, the median page length of prospectuses filed by listed BDCs is approximately 234 page s . <sup>365</sup>

<h>3. Current Disclosure Obligations of Affected Funds</h>

Affected funds differ in their periodic and current reporting obligations. Like operating companies, BDCs file annual reports with audited financials on Form 10-K, quarterly reports with unaudited financials on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. Registered CEFs file annual reports to shareholders with audited financials and semi- annual reports to shareholders with unaudited financials on Form N-CSR. Listed registered CEFs are also subject to exchange rules that require listed issuers to providethe market current information in response to certain events ( e.g. , dividends announcements through a press release or report on Form 8-K). <sup>366</sup>

<h>B. Potential Benefits Resulting from the Proposed Implementation of the Statutory Mandates</h>

As discussed, the amendments to implement the statutory mandates are designed to provide securities offering parity between affected funds and operating companies and streamline the registration process for BDCs and registered CEFs, consistent with the BDC Act and the Registered CEF Act. We believe that the final rule will achieve this goal and consequently result in significant benefits in a number of areas, including by improving access to the public capital markets and possibly lowering the cost of capitalby, among other things, modifying our rules related to affected funds’ ability to qualify as

WKSIs, to use the full shelf registration process, and to engage in certain communications during a registered offering. <sup>367</sup> Additionally, as discussed below, we believe that the final rule will provide benefits to investors as well, including byincreasing the flow of valuable information that could be available to investors to inform their investment decisions. Finally, we believe that the final rule will provide cost-saving options to affected fund issuers and underwriters.

<h>1. Improved Access to Capital and Lower Cost of Capital</h>

We anticipate that the final rule will facilitate capital formation and possibly lower the cost of capital by improving access to the public capital markets for affected funds. The rule is designed to reduce regulatory impediments to capital formation andprovide more flexibility to these funds to conduct registered securities offerings. The amount of flexibility accorded by the final rule will depend on the characteristics of the affected fund, consistent with our rules’ treatment of similarly-situated operating companies. For example, and as explained below, certain affected funds like large listed BDCs and large listed registered CEFs are expected to benefit more from the final rule than unlisted BDCs and unlisted registered CEFs, including unlisted interval funds. The final rule will provide the most flexibility under the communications rules and the automatic shelf registration system to eligible WKSIs. Other affected funds, such as seasoned affected funds, also will benefit, albeit to a lesser degree, from the other revisions to the offering process and our communications rules.

<h>a. Benefits from WKSI Status</h>

The largest increase in capital formation and reduction in cost of capital that the final rule could generate will come from allowing affected funds to obtain WKSI status. Affected funds that qualify as WKSIs will enjoy additional flexibility compared to affected funds that are non-WKSIs. <sup>368</sup> There are <sup>100</sup> affected funds (15 listed BDCs and 85 listed registered CEFs) that meet the $700 million dollar public float criterion as of June 30, 2019. <sup>369</sup> A shelf registration statement and any subsequent amendments filed by a WKSI are automatically effective upon filing. This flexibility will allow affected funds that qualify as WKSIs to promptly tap favorable conditions in the public market, to structure terms of securities on a real-time basis to accommodate investor demand, and to determine or change the plan of distribution in response to changing market conditions.

For example, because affected funds typically trade at a discount to their NAV, <sup>370</sup> affected funds that are WKSIs will be able to act more quickly to raise capital when their shares are trading at a premium, <sup>371</sup> thus increasing the amount of capital raised and enhancing capital formation.

Additionally, WKSIs are not required to pay any registration fees at the time of filing a registration statement. They are only required to pay the registration filing fee at the time securities are taken down and sold off the shelf registration statement. This will provide additional flexibility to qualifying affected funds in that they need only incur such filing fees if and when they decide to proceed with an offering. The final rule may also lower the cost of capital because it will provide significant flexibility to affected funds that are WKSIs and their underwriters in marketing securities. The final communications rules will allow these funds to communicate at any time regarding an offering.

Requiring an affected fund to have at least $700 million in public float to qualify as a WKSI will avoid providing affected funds with an advantage in the competition for capital over certain operating companies. For example, a lower public float threshold for affected funds would provide them with a competitive advantage over operatingcompanies that may have similar characteristics to affected funds, such as listed REITs,but have public float below $700 million. In a similar vein, the use of alternative eligibility criteria for affected funds to qualify as WKSIs would put them at competitive advantage compared to similar operating companies without public float, such as unlisted REITs. Moreover, reducing the $700 million threshold or providing alternative eligibility criteria for affected funds to qualify as WKSIs would likely lead to potential higher incidences of disclosure and fund practices that may not comply with applicable law due to reduced staff review. <sup>372</sup>

Given the important benefits that WKSI status provides, and the fact that currently only few affected funds would qualify as WKSIs, it is possible that advisers to some affected funds may try, through various means, including raising additional capital and mergers and acquisitions, to increase their funds’ public float to the WKSI threshold. Thus, the possible effects of the rule may include increased fund size and consolidation of affected funds. Such developments may increase efficiency by allowing the larger resulting funds to benefit from improved access and lower cost of capital. We also recognize that consolidation may be driven by other factors as well, in combination with the effects of the rule, and typically would be subject to certain approvals by a fund’s board of directors or shareholders. <sup>373</sup> Potential consolidation and increases in fund size could also reduce costs to investors by, for example, allowing an affected fund to realize greater efficiencies and reduce its total operating expenses over time. However, consolidation also could inhibit competition and negatively affect the number ofinvestment opportunities available to investors if it leads to a reduction of the number of strategies funds employ. It is possible that new funds will enter the market thereby increasing competition and investment opportunities. Potential consolidation of affected funds could make it more difficult for new or smaller funds to compete since funds with larger amounts of assets may have better access to certain investment opportunities or may be able to offer lower costs to investors. Smaller funds, however, may have better access to investment opportunities in smaller companies because these investments may be too small to be economically viable for larger funds. At present, we are not able toestimate the effects of these competitive dynamics.

<h>b. Benefits from Shelf Registration</h>

Other provisions of the final rule could also enhance capital formation and lower the cost of offerings for affected funds that qualify as seasoned funds and file a short- form registration statement on Form N-2. <sup>374</sup> For example, the final rule generally allows these funds to more efficiently use the shelf registration process if, like operating companies, they meet the eligibility requirements of Form S-3. <sup>375</sup> As of June 30, 2019, there were <sup>499</sup> affected funds that met the $75 million dollar public float criterion for primary offerings under Form S-3 (which criterion is incorporated into the short-form registration instruction of Form N-2). <sup>376</sup> Affected funds that qualify will bear fewer costs associated with updating the information in their registration statements becauseinformation in the fund’s Exchange Act reports will be incorporated by reference into the fund’s registration statement. For example, for PRA purposes, we estimate that eligible affected funds will file approximately 128 fewer post-effective amendments annually as a result of the amendments, resulting in an annual aggregate cost reduction of approximately $5,726,592 for these funds. <sup>377</sup> Additionally, we understand that currently BDCs often file prospectus supplements close-in-time to filing their current and periodic Exchange Act reports to make sure the BDC’s prospectus disclosure provides the same information as that disclosed in its Exchange Act reports. Under the final rule, eligible BDCs will no longer file these prospectus supplements since their Exchange Act reports will be incorporated by reference into their registration statements. As a result, an eligible BDC may, on average, file approximately <sup>14</sup> fewer prospectus supplements on an annual basis under the rule. <sup>378</sup> We anticipate that eligible registered CEFs also will be able tomake fewer prospectus supplement filings under the final rule, although they likely will

IV.B.1. The total annual cost is calculated by adding the monetized internal burden ($33,625 x 128 post-effective amendments = $4,304,000) to the cost of outsideprofessionals ($11,114 x 128 post-effective amendments = $1,422,592). Although we have increased the expected reduction in the number of post-effective amendments discussed in the Proposing Release from 112 to 128 filings, the estimated annual aggregate cost reduction has decreased from $7,943,376 to $5,726,592 to better recognize how we have monetized internal burdens for purposes of the PRA. See Proposing Release, supra footnote <sup>10</sup> , at n.359 and accompanying text; infra section IV.B.1 .not experience as large of a reduction in filings since, among other things, they file periodic reports on a semi-annual basis (rather than quarterly) and generally are not required to report on Form 8-K. While we believe that affected funds will likely file fewer prospectus supplements under the final amendments, we are unable to estimate any reduction in the number of prospectus supplements that affected funds will file under the final rule, and any associated cost savings for affected funds, due to certain counterbalancing factors. For example, if the final rule causes affected funds to increase their capital-raising activities, they may need to update their prospectuses more often andmay file more prospectus supplements as a result. However, if affected funds begin to use their Exchange Act reports to update their prospectuses, as permitted under the final amendments, they may file fewer prospectus supplements. <sup>379</sup> On average, we believe that affected funds will likely file fewer prospectus supplements under the final amendments since they will be able to update their prospectus more efficiently by forward incorporating their Exchange Act reports, although an affected fund that greatly increases its capital-raising activities may not experience the same reduction in filing burdens.

In general, we believe affected funds that qualify for the short-form registration instruction will experience cost savings associated with making fewer filings and will be able to use a more efficient process to update their prospectus disclosure. This willdecrease the costs of eligible funds’ registered offerings and will also allow them to act more quickly to take advantage of favorable market conditions ( e.g. , when trading at a premium). Certain seasoned funds registering shelf offerings also will be able to omit certain information from their prospectuses and use the same process as operatingcompanies to provide omitted information by filing a prospectus supplement, which will generally make the shelf registration process less costly for these funds as compared to the baseline.

The final rule also may provide incremental cost savings to affected funds that are eligible to file a short-form registration statement in certain other respects. For example, the final rule will reduce the costs of these funds seeking shareholder approval for proposals to authorize, issue, modify, or exchange securities by allowing them toincorporate by reference certain materials rather than delivering these materials to security holders with the proxy statement. <sup>380</sup> We do not anticipate that these cost savings will be substantial, however, as we understand that affected funds do not often make these types of proposals to security holders. Affected funds that are eligible to file a short-form registration statement also could experience modest cost savings from the amendment to rule <sup>418</sup> since they will no longer be required by that rule to furnish certain information to the Commission or its staff promptly on request. <sup>381</sup>

<h>c. Other Benefits for Affected Funds</h>

The final rule will generate other benefits for affected funds generally, regardless of whether they are WKSIs or seasoned funds. For example, the amendment to require affected funds to follow the same process that operating companies follow to file prospectuses under rule <sup>424</sup> will require that affected funds file prospectus supplements when changes from or additions to a previously filed prospectus are substantive, whereas currently they are required to file every prospectus that varies from any previously filedprospectus under rule 497. <sup>382</sup> Rule <sup>424</sup> also is designed to work together with rule 415(a)(1)(x), and provides additional time for an issuer to file a prospectus. This change could modestly reduce filing burdens and should facilitate eligible funds using the shelf registration process efficiently and in parity with operating companies. Also, the final rule allows an affected fund to satisfy its obligation to deliver a final prospectus by filing it with the Commission and complying with certain other requirements, thus decreasing the cost of the offering. <sup>383</sup> For example, the final rule will permit affected funds to save on printing and mailing costs for delivering the final prospectus in paper. <sup>384</sup>

In general, commenters stated that the rule will generate benefits for affected funds. Several commenters stated that the proposed rule would lead to a more efficient capital-raising process. <sup>385</sup> One commenter suggested that the proposed rule could alsohelp encourage product development that would expand the universe of registered CEFs, but did not elaborate on the specific aspects of the rulemaking that would encourage product development. <sup>386</sup>

<h>d. Benefits for Other Parties</h>

The lower costs of registered offerings resulting from the final rule should benefit investors in affected funds because funds bear offering expenses. Lowering offeringexpenses may, all else equal, reduce the size of the discount or increase the size of thepremium at which shares of the affected funds trade. Two commenters expressed similar views, arguing that the proposed rule would provide cost savings to funds’shareholders. <sup>387</sup>

In addition, the final rule could reduce the cost to underwriters of participating in registered offerings of affected funds, and these potential cost savings could be passed on to the affected funds. Based on the sheer volume and number of transactions, <sup>388</sup> underwriters may have more expertise and established procedures for operating companies’ registered offerings, which are subject to the rules we are extending to affected funds. In contrast, underwriters probably have less, or more concentrated, expertise regarding the current requirements for offerings by affected funds.

Standardization in the registered offering space, by making the offerings of affected funds more similar to those of operating companies, could make it easier for underwriters to execute such offerings and may decrease their compliance costs. If underwriters pass some of the cost savings on to affected funds and their investors, this could result inpapers/dera_white_paper_regulation_d_082018.cheaper registered offerings for affected funds, thus encouraging them to raise more capital, which would lead to enhanced capital formation. Lastly, standardization may encourage a broader set of underwriters to participate in this market, potentiallydecreasing costs for affected funds and investors in these funds. One commenter agreed that the proposed rule would make it easier for underwriters to execute offerings by affected funds, which could lead to decreased costs. <sup>389</sup>

The final rule could level the securities offering playing field between affected funds and operating companies and streamline the registration process for affected funds, consequently making them potentially more competitive in the market for capital raising.

The final rule may also make certain affected funds more competitive compared toaffected funds that either cannot or choose not to rely on these amendments. Thus, the final rule will likely enhance competition in the public capital markets. The increased competition for capital in turn could lead to potentially better allocation of capital. The final rule may also benefit companies in which affected funds invest. Small and mid-size companies, because of their size, type of assets, risk profile, and the general lack of information about their activities and financial condition, typically find it more difficult to raise funds from traditional sources of capital such as bank loans and registered offerings. <sup>390</sup> This difficulty in sourcing more traditional financing constrains their abilityto invest in profitable projects and grow. To the extent that the final rule improvescapital-raising opportunities for affected funds that invest in these companies, this may result in investments in a greater number of small to mid-size U.S. companies, thus alleviating financial constraints of such companies and contributing to economic growth generally. <sup>391</sup> Commenters generally agreed that the proposed rule would facilitate capital formation, especially for small to mid-size businesses. <sup>392</sup> One commenter stated that the proposed rule could potentially stimulate economic growth. <sup>393</sup>

<h>2. Facilitated Communication with Investors</h>

The final rule will provide incremental flexibility to funds in their communications, which may increase the flow of information to investors. <sup>394</sup> Currently, affected funds generally are unable to communicate about an offering before a registration statement is filed, and their post-filing communications are subject to prospectus liability under section 12 of the Securities Act (or must be accompanied or preceded by the statutory prospectus). <sup>395</sup>

This standardization in the communications processes of affected funds, by making them similar to those of operating companies, will make it easier for underwritersto execute offerings by affected funds and thus may decrease their compliance costs, which in turn may lead to lower offering costs and potentially enhance capital formation. Additionally, under the final rule, affected funds that qualify as WKSIs can engage in the widest range of communications, including free writing prospectus communications about an offering with any party before a registration statement is filed. More generally, affected funds will be able to engage in certain other pre-filing communications, use free writing prospectuses after a registration statement is filed, and use certain communications that are not subject to prospectus liability. The changes in the communications rules for affected funds may increase the amount of valuableinformation that could be provided to investors before they make investment decisions, particularly with respect to WKSIs. We believe that more information could be provided on a timelier basis because the amendments will eliminate regulatory barriers to the dissemination of that information, and the markets may provide incentives for issuers, underwriters, and broker-dealers to produce additional information. We also believe that the increased flexibility of affected funds in their communications with investors under the free writing prospectus rules will maintain appropriate investor protection, consistent with the protections that apply to affected funds’ communications under rule 482. For example, the rules that allow affected funds to use free writing prospectuses are designed to assure that written issuer-provided or issuer-used information is publicly available.

Additionally, the free writing prospectus will be a section 10(b) prospectus under the Securities Act and, as such, will be subject to liability under section 12(a)(2) as well as the anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities laws.

Increased information flow can help promote efficient capital markets because the market may be able to value securities more accurately. For example, the final rule willpermit broker-dealers to disseminate research about an affected fund if certain conditions are met. While broker-dealers currently may disseminate such research under rule 482, the amendments to rule <sup>138</sup> will likely reduce certain costs to broker-dealers associated with rule <sup>482</sup> ( e.g. , filing costs and concerns associated with prospectus liability). This could allow more valuable information about affected funds to reach potential investors. Another benefit of increasing the information flow is that investors may become better informed in making portfolio allocation decisions in accordance with their particular risk- return profiles. In addition, the final rule may benefit broker-dealers who provideresearch reports on affected funds by reducing their potential liability exposure associated with such reports, relative to the baseline, which may encourage them to provide additional research and enhance information flow. Commenters generally agreed that the proposed rule would provide more flexibility for affected funds to communicate and would increase information flow. <sup>396</sup>

<h>C. Pote ntial Costs Resulting from the Propose d Imple me ntation of the Statutory Mandate s</h>

<h>1. Compliance Costs</h>

The amendments we are adopting to implement the statutory mandates couldincrease affected funds’ compliance costs in certain respects. <sup>397</sup> We also are cognizant of the fact that such an increase could be passed on to funds’ investors. A potential cost of the final rule is that affected funds could incur increased filing or recordkeeping costsassociated with issuer free writing prospectuses, <sup>398</sup> although affected funds currently face many of the same filing and recordkeeping costs under rule 482. For example, the ability of affected funds that qualify as WKSIs to use free writing prospectuses may increase the level of these funds’ current communications (including certain communications prior to filing a registration statement that are presently prohibited), thus increasing the funds’ filing and recordkeeping costs. <sup>399</sup> We estimate that affected funds that are WKSIs would have additional annual filing and recordkeeping costs of $200 per affected fund for free writing prospectuses used before the fund files a registration statement. <sup>400</sup> To the extent affected funds use free writing prospectuses for communications that currently occur under rule 482, the costs associated with free writing prospectuses could increase, and the costs associated with rule <sup>482</sup> advertisements could decrease. We are unable to predict, however, whether affected funds will be more likely to use free writing prospectuses than rule 482 communications or to engage in more communications with investors in practice as a result of the amendments.

Affected funds could also incur costs associated with adjusting their internal procedures for filing prospectus supplements. <sup>401</sup> Such costs could stem from the need to augment funds’ information technology systems or train funds’ employees, although, as recognized above, affected funds likely will be able to file fewer prospectus supplements under the final rule.

Parties that will be required to provide notices under rule 173, <sup>402</sup> including underwriters and dealers in certain circumstances, may incur additional costs due to the requirement to notify affected fund investors that they have purchased shares in a registered offering. In addition, these same parties may incur costs to establish procedures for receiving and complying with requests for final prospectuses. We believe that providing the notice to investors will not impose a significant incremental cost because the notice can consist of a pre-printed message that is automatically delivered with or as part of the confirmation required by 17 CFR 240.10b-10 (Exchange Act rule 10b-10).

Accordingly, we estimate that the cost of complying with rule 173 will be approximately$0.05 per notice. <sup>403</sup> We estimate the annual cost of providing the notification will be approximately $831,729. <sup>404</sup> For the parties that are required to provide such notices, theseadditional costs of complying with rule 173 will be mitigated to a certain degree by the elimination of the requirement to supply a final prospectus to each investor.

<h>2. Other Costs</h>

Under the final rule, affected funds that qualify as WKSIs will be able to file shelf registration statements and post-effective amendments that become automatically effective. To the extent that investors previously benefited from the Commission staff’s review of these filings before they become effective, allowing these filings of affected funds that are WKSIs to become automatically effective may eliminate such reviews and, as a result, possibly increase the costs to investors. Allowing affected funds that fileshort-form registration statements on Form N-2 to forward incorporate by reference couldhave a similar potential impact on investors. However, issuers will still face liability under the Federal securities laws for registration statement disclosures ( e.g. , sections <sup>12</sup> and 17 of the Securities Act and section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and <sup>17</sup> CFR 240.10b- <sup>10</sup> (rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act)), which may ameliorate the potential costsassociated with reduced staff review. <sup>405</sup>

More generally, allowing forward incorporation by reference under the short-form registration instruction could increase the analytical burden and search costs for potential investors. Currently, affected funds provide required information in the prospectus that is delivered to investors, and forward incorporation by reference is not allowed. Under the amendments, instead of having all the information available in one location, investorsmay need to separately access on a website or request the incorporated materials. As a result, costs to investors for assembling and assimilating necessary information could increase, with a potentially stronger effect for retail investors ( e.g. , because theygenerally may not have the technical capabilities or monetary resources to efficiently search through several information sources). We do not have data to assess if, and to what extent, this revision will burden investors.

However, an affected fund making a shelf offering under rule 415(a)(1)(x) is required to file a new registration statement every three years, which provides investors with a periodic update of consolidated information. <sup>406</sup> The final rule will require that affected funds provide in their annual reports certain information currently disclosed in their prospectuses to make the information more readily available in one document for investors. <sup>407</sup> Further, Securities Act Forms S-3 and F-3 have long permitted incorporation by reference from the issuer’s Exchange Act reports, and investors have not indicated they are unduly burdened when investing in offerings registered on these Forms. <sup>408</sup> Studies have shown, however, that the majority of investors in operating companies are institutiona l investors, whereas the majority of investors in the securities of affected funds are retail investors, who may face relatively higher costs associated with searching for information distributed across multiple documents. <sup>409</sup> In addition, the requirement tobackward and forward incorporate by reference certain information into a short-form registration statement could increase an affected fund’s liability with respect to information that has not previously been incorporated into its registration statement because this information will now be part of the registration statement. This could increase costs for relevant funds, including potential legal costs ( e.g. , those associated with additional review of materials that would be incorporated by reference into thefund’s registration statement, or counsel and other costs in connection with potential legal actions). These potential cost increases could be passed on to investors of affected funds.

The final rule will allow an affected fund to not deliver final prospectuses directly to investors if the fund files the final prospectus with the Commission and certain other conditions are satisfied. We acknowledge, however, that while this procedure has become commonplace in many aspects of our capital markets, there may be some investors who would prefer to receive the prospectus directly. While an investor could request a copy of the final prospectus under rule 173, there will be burdens on an investor to make such a request ( e.g. , loss of time while making the request and a delay in receiving the prospectus). Thus, investors without home internet access, depending on their ability and preference to access fund information electronically, might experience a reduction intheir ability to access a fund’s final prospectus. To the extent that a reduction in this information by such investors decreases how informed they are about affected funds, itcould potentially decrease their ability to efficiently allocate capital across affected fundsand other investments. However, an investor’s purchase commitment and the resulting

Institutional Investors and Stock Market Liquidity: Trends and Relationships, Working Paper, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania (Aug. 21, 2012).contract of sale of securities to the investor in the offering generally occur before the final prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, and this is commonplace in other parts of our capital markets. Moreover, for sales occurring in the secondary market, as a result of our existing rules, investors in securities of reporting issuers generally are not delivered a final prospectus . <sup>410</sup>

<h>D. Alte rnative s to Adopte d Approach to Imple me nting Statutory Mandate s</h>

We considered certain alternative approaches to implementing the directives in the BDC Act and Registered CEF Act to allow affected funds to use the securities offering rules that are available to operating companies. Although the BDC Act identifies certain required amendments to our rules and forms, we could have, for example, made additional modifications to the relevant provisions for affected funds or further revised the current registration and offering framework affected funds use.

For example, as discussed above, we considered modifying the public float standards in the WKSI definition or the short-form registration instruction by changing the required level of public float or providing alternative eligibility criteria, such as the aggregate NAV of a certain size for funds whose shares are not traded on an exchange. <sup>411</sup> Several commenters supported changing the public float standards in the WKSIdefinition for affected funds. <sup>412</sup> These alternatives could have allowed more affected funds to qualify as WKSIs or to file short-form registration statements, with theassociated benefits ( e.g. , lower costs of registered offerings) and costs ( e.g. , potential higher incidence of disclosure and fund practices that may not comply with applicable law due to reduced staff review) discussed above. For example, most interval funds do not list their securities on an exchange and do not have “public float,” and thesealternatives therefore could have permitted these interval funds, as well as other unlisted affected funds, to qualify as WKSIs or file short-form registration statements. However, modifying the eligibility criteria in the WKSI definition or the short-form registration instruction could give affected funds that do not have the requisite public float under the current WKSI definition or Form S-3 eligibility requirements an advantage over certain operating companies that do not have public float or do not meet the $700 million public float requirement. In addition, certain of the benefits that flow from WKSI status or the ability to use a short-form registration statement may be less relevant to unlisted affected funds that engage in continuous offerings. <sup>413</sup> Further, interval funds already have a tailored registration process that provides similar efficiencies. For example, certain of an interval fund’s post-effective amendments are immediately effective upon filing ( e.g. , filings solely to update the fund’s financial statements or to make non-material changes), while other post-effective amendments ( e.g. , filings to make material changes) are automatically effective <sup>60</sup> days after filing unless the fund designates a later date foreffectiveness. In addition, we are extending this process to allow other continuously- offered unlisted affected funds to file immediately-effective post-effective amendments under the same circumstances as interval funds. Specifically, we are amending rule <sup>486</sup> to allow certain unlisted continuously-offered affected funds to maintain effectiveregistration statements in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. We believe that amended rule <sup>486</sup> will provide these funds with benefits that are similar to the benefits we are providing to affected funds that qualify to file short-form registration statements or as WKSIs. Interval funds and other continuously-offered unlisted affected funds, however, will not experience the same efficiencies as affected funds that qualify to fileshort-form registration statements or as WKSIs when they make material changes to their registration statements. This is because these filings by interval funds and other continuously-offered unlisted affected will be subject to staff review and will not be immediately effective upon filing.

Under the BDC Act and the Registered CEF Act, we could have extended the final rule only to BDCs, listed registered CEFs, and interval funds. Under this approach, unlisted registered CEFs would not have been able to take advantage of certain benefits of the amendments that would otherwise be available to unlisted BDCs, such as the cost savings associated with the final prospectus delivery reforms. <sup>414</sup> This alternative also could have saved unlisted registered CEFs certain compliance costs stemming from the proposed rulemaking, such as the requirement to tag certain prospectus information using Inline XBRL. However, excluding unlisted registered CEFs from the final rule couldcreate unnecessary competitive disparities between unlisted registered CEFs and unlisted BDCs and would not provide investors in unlisted registered CEFs with the benefits of the new investor protections we are adopting.

<h>E. Discussion of Discre tionary Choice s</h>

We discuss below the discretionary amendments that we are adopting, in light of the changes to implement the BDC Act and Registered CEF Act and the associated benefits and costs of those choices. We have tried to quantify the impact of each of the amendments, but in many cases, reliable, empirical evidence about the effects is not readily available to the Commission.

With respect to the proposed discretionary amendments, one commenter stated that the proposal would impose regulatory and compliance costs on unlisted affected funds, while at the same time providing unlisted interval funds with only small benefits and providing no benefits to other unlisted affected funds ( e.g. , tender offer funds). <sup>415</sup> We believe interval funds and other continuously-offered unlisted affected funds will directly benefit from two of our discretionary amendments. <sup>416</sup> While the final rule also imposescertain costs on these funds, we believe those costs are warranted, as discussed in detail below. Moreover, we are not at this time adopting the proposed new reporting requirements on Form 8-K that would have imposed costs on unlisted affected funds. <sup>417</sup>

<h>1. New Registration Fee Payment Method for Interval Funds and Issuers of Certain Exchange-Traded Products</h>

We are adopting a modernized approach to registration fee payment for interval funds that will require them to pay securities registration fees using the same method that mutual funds and ETFs use today. In response to comments, we also are allowing certain

ETPs that are not registered under the Investment Company Act to use a similar method to pay registration fees.

With respect to interval funds, the final rule requires these funds to pay their registration fees on a net basis once a year, rather than having to pay registration fees when the fund files its registration statement. <sup>418</sup> We believe this approach will make the registration fee payment process for interval funds more efficient. For example, it will avoid the possibility that an interval fund will inadvertently sell more shares than it has registered and will not require the issuer to periodically register new shares.

We believe the final rule could also benefit interval funds by reducing their initial registration fees. In the table below, we have attempted to quantify the potential initial cost-savings for interval funds under the modernized approach to registration fee payment over a 3-year period. <sup>419</sup>

T A BLE 4

Notes:

1. T he current average registration fee paid in year 1 is the average of the actual fees reported by the interval funds in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in Form N-2 in the year of registration with the Commission. For purposes of this analysis, we assume that interval funds did not register additional securities in years 2 or 3. If they did, the average registration fees under the current framework would be higher than $31,501.

2. For each of the interval funds, the fees in years 1, 2, and 3 are estimated as [(dollar proceeds from shares issued + dollar cost of shares repurchased) / $1,000,000] x $129.80. T he $129.80 is the fee rate (per million dollars) that funds pay to register shares for fiscal year 2020. Then we calculate the average fees per year.

Under the current regime, an interval fund would pay on average $31,501 at the time of filing, and then issue and repurchase securities over time. Under the regime weare adopting, the interval fund will pay its registration fees on a net basis once a year. Since the final rule allows interval funds to shift more of the fee payments to the future, it will decrease their cost of offering securities. An interval fund will, however, be required to annually file Form 24F-2. <sup>420</sup> We estimate the annual burden of filing Form 24F-2 for interval funds will be $140 per fund. <sup>421</sup>

We believe the final rule will provide similar benefits to certain ETPs that are not registered under the Investment Company Act by allowing these ETPs to elect to register an indeterminate number of securities and to pay registration fees in arrears on an annual net basis. Since now ETPs pay registration fees in advance whether or not they sell any securities and may not factor in redemptions in reducing the amount of the registrationfees owed, this change will allow them to reduce their registration fees and shift their payment obligations into future periods. The amendments will also avoid the possibility that such an ETP will inadvertently sell more shares than it has registered and will not require the issuer to periodically register new shares. Moreover, the amendments will allow ETPs that are not registered under the Investment Company Act to use a similar registration fee payment method as ETFs that are registered under the Investment Company Act.

As an alternative, we considered allowing a wider range of affected funds, such as registered CEFs that are tender offer funds, to rely on rule 24f-2. This approach wouldhave extended the benefits of rule 24f-2 to additional affected funds. However, as discussed above, interval funds have structural similarities to mutual funds and ETFs that other affected funds do not. In particular, interval funds routinely repurchase shares at NAV and are required to periodically offer to repurchase their shares, and therefore are more likely to realize the operational benefits of computing registration fees on a net annual basis than are funds that are not required to periodically offer to repurchase their shares at NAV.

<h>2. Structured Data Requirements</h>

The final rule includes new structured data reporting requirements for affected funds. Specifically, all affected funds will be required to tag in Inline XBRL formatcertain Form N-2 prospectus disclosure items. All affected funds also will be required to tag the information on the cover page of Form N-2 using Inline XBRL. Finally, BDCs will be required to tag financial statement information using Inline XBRL.

Under the final rule, affected funds will be required to tag the following Form N-2 prospectus disclosure items using Inline XBRL: Fee Table; Senior Securities Table;

Investment Objectives and Policies; Risk Factors; Share Price Data; and Capital Stock,

Long-Term Debt, and Other Securities. <sup>422</sup> These items provide important information about an affected fund’s key features, costs, and risks and may be particularly useful to investors to inform their investment decisions. With respect to the requirement that BDCs tag financial statement information, unlike operating companies and registeredinvestment companies, BDCs currently are not required to report any structured data. <sup>423</sup>

This requirement will extend to BDCs a requirement that currently applies to operating companies.

Requiring BDCs to tag financial statement information using Inline XBRL, and all affected funds to tag in Inline XBRL format certain important prospectus disclosure items, will provide important benefits to investors seeking to access information about affected funds, both directly and through information intermediaries such as data aggregators and financial analysts. Providing a standardized, interactive, computer-based framework for reporting could further facilitate more efficient investor comparisons of important information across affected funds by making it easier to aggregate and analyze information through automated means, which could increase competition for investorcapital. The Inline XBRL tagging requirements may also potentially increase the efficiency of capital formation to the extent that making disclosures available in a structured format reduces some of the information barriers facing prospective investors and makes it easier for affected funds to attract investors. One commenter expressed similar views. <sup>424</sup>

Smaller affected funds in particular may benefit more from enhanced exposure to investors. To the extent that reporting the disclosures in a structured format increases the availability, or reduces the cost of collecting and analyzing, key information about affected funds, smaller affected funds may benefit from improved coverage by information intermediaries. Further, requiring affected funds to tag certain prospectus disclosures using Inline XBRL would facilitate monitoring of these disclosures by investors and information intermediaries, potentially increasing transparency andmitigating the potential informational costs stemming from other aspects of the proposal such as automatic shelf registration statements for WKSIs and short-form registration statements for eligible funds, which may result in required disclosures being distributed across multiple regulatory filings and could thereby affect investor protection. <sup>425</sup>

The cover page tagging requirement includes new check boxes that will help identify whether a registration statement is, for example, an automatic shelf registration statement or a short-form registration statement. <sup>426</sup> We already require registrants to tag all of the information on the cover page of Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Form 8-K, Form20-F, and Form 40-F using Inline XBRL. <sup>427</sup> The requirement to tag the Form N-2 cover page in Inline XBRL is expected to benefit investors by enabling investors and information intermediaries to automate their use of the cover page information, including company name, the Act or Acts to which the registration statement relates, and check boxes relating to the effectiveness of the registration statement. This will enhance the ability of investors and information intermediaries to identify, count, sort, and analyze registrants and disclosures to the extent these data points otherwise would be formatted, for example, in HTML. The check boxes, which are required to be tagged in Inline

XBRL format, will allow investors and information intermediaries to distinguish between different categories of registration statements in much the same way they are currently able to do for operating companies. The availability of information in Inline XBRL could enable investors and information intermediaries to capture and analyze cover pageinformation more quickly and at a lower cost, as well as to search and analyze the information dynamically. It could also facilitate comparison of information across filers and reporting periods.

Affected funds will incur some costs to tag and review the required information in Inline XBRL. Some filers may perform the tagging in-house while others may retain outside service providers. We expect filers will incur costs for the fees of the outside service providers. Various XBRL preparation solutions have been developed and used by operating companies and open-end fund filers, and some evidence suggests that, for operating companies, XBRL tagging costs have decreased over time . <sup>428</sup> While this evidence is specific to XBRL tagging costs rather than Inline XBRL tagging costs,because Inline XBRL allows filers to embed XBRL data directly into an HTML document, we expect Inline XBRL costs to be even lower than XBRL costs since Inline XBRL eliminates the need to tag a copy of the information in a separate XBRL exhibit. Costs of Inline XBRL preparation may depend on the familiarity of the filer and/or its service provider with Inline XBRL. Filers that currently report information in Inline XBRL for other investment products they offer, such as open-end funds, filing affected fund information in Inline XBRL under the amendments will likely incur lower costs ofcompliance than filers adopting Inline XBRL for the first time. Those registrants affected

Accounting Today (Aug. 15, 2018), available athttps:// www.accountingtoday.com/news/aicpa-sees-45-drop-in-xbrl-cos ts-for-small- reporting-companies (stating that, according to an updated survey by AICPA and XBRL US, the cost of formatting financial statements in XBRL for smaller reporting companies has declined 45% since 2014 and that 68.6% of the companies paid $5,500 or less on an annual basis (as compared to 29.9% of companies in the 2014 survey) for fully outsourced creation and filing solutions for their XBRL filings, while 11.8% of the companies surveyed paid annual costs between $5,500 to as much as $8,000 for their full- service outsourced solutions).by the requirement that have not had experience structuring disclosures in other contexts will likely incur initial costs to acquire the necessary expertise and/or software as well as ongoing costs of tagging required information in Inline XBRL, and any fixed costs of complying with the Inline XBRL requirement may have a relatively greater impact on smaller filers. On an ongoing basis, registrants are expected to expend time to tag and review the tagged information in Inline XBRL using their in-house staff. Some registrants may also incur an initial cost to license filing preparation software with Inline XBRL capabilities from a software vendor, and some may also incur an ongoinglicensing cost. Other registrants may incur an initial cost to modify their existing filing preparation software to accommodate Inline XBRL preparation. Some registrants will incur the costs of filing agent services to rely on a filing agent to prepare their Inline XBRL filings. Initial costs involving investments in expertise and modifications to disclosure preparation solutions, or switching to a different software vendor or outside service provider, may result in a higher compliance cost during the first year of using Inline XBRL than in subsequent years.

The costs of compliance with the Inline XBRL requirements are likely to vary across registrants. On average we estimate that the compliance cost to BDCs of taggingfinancial statement information, certain prospectus disclosure items, and Form N-2 coverpage information using Inline XBRL will be approximately $161,179 per BDC per year in the 3 years following the adoption of the rule. <sup>429</sup> We estimate that the compliance costto registered CEFs of tagging in Inline XBRL format certain prospectus disclosure items and tagging Form N-2 cover page information will be approximately $8,855 per registered CEF per year in the 3 years following the adoption of the rule. <sup>430</sup> We note that some recent surveys based on operating companies suggest that these current PRA-based burden estimates may be overstated with respect to affected funds, and particularly smaller affected funds. <sup>431</sup>

One commenter cited a study by the European Securities and Markets Authority estimating the cost of preparing Inline XBRL in-house to be on average around 8,200 euros for the first filing and 2,400 euros for each subsequent filing. <sup>432</sup> In case ofoutside services ($3,555,931 for tagging financial statement information, $156,634 for certain prospectus disclosure items, and $0 for Form N-2 cover page information using Inline XBRL). See infra section IV.B.2 . We monetize the burden of in-house Inline XBRL preparation by multiplying the burden hours by an estimated wage rate of $400 per hour (33,028 x $400 = $13,211,200). The estimated wage figure is based on analysis in previous rulemakings. The average cost per BDC is calculated by adding the monetized internal burden ($13,211,200) to the cost of outside services ($3,712,565) and dividing by the number of BDCs (105). See also supra footnote <sup>355</sup> .$400 = $5,051,200). The estimated wage figure is based on analysis in previous rulemakings. The average cost per registered CEF is calculated by adding the monetized internal burden ($5,051,200) to the cost of outside services ($1,023,345) and dividing by the number of registered CEFs (686).

According to AICPA Study (Aug. 18, 2018), available athttps:// www.aicpa.org/press/pressreleases/2018/xbrl-costs-have-declined-according-to-aicpa-study.html; CFA Institute, The Cost of Structured Data: Myth vs. Reality (2017) , available at https: //w ww .cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/survey/the-cost-of-structured-data-myth-vs-reality-august-2017.ashx.outsourcing, the study estimates the costs to be on average around 13,000 euros for the first filing and 4,600 euros for each subsequent filing. However, we do not believe that these figures the commenter cited are salient to the structured data requirements we are adopting. For example, although not cited by the commenter, the same study mentions that in the United States, because of the detailed tagging and extended taxonomy, the average costs for outsourcing the preparation of the financial statements in XBRL is higher, between 9,000 euros and 19,000 euros. <sup>433</sup>

As an alternative, we could have allowed but not required affected funds to present cover page, financial statement, and certain prospectus disclosure information in Inline XBRL. Compared to the final rule, a fully voluntary Inline XBRL program would lower costs for those filers that do not find Inline XBRL to be cost efficient. We also could have required Inline XBRL tagging only for a subset of affected funds—forexample, affected funds that file short-form registration statements on Form N-2 or WKSIs. We also could have permitted more than one structured data format or left the precise format unspecified. However, a voluntary program or the use of multiple structured data formats would also reduce potential data quality benefits compared to mandatory Inline XBRL, as would a program that captures only a subset of affected funds. If the information were not submitted by all affected funds in a standardized, structured, machine-readable format, investors who seek to instantly analyze, aggregate,https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/2016- 1668_esma_feedback_statement_on_the_rts_on_esef_0.pdf .and compare the data would have to incur the costs of paying a third-party service provider to manually rekey the data, review the data for data quality problems during the duplication process, and disseminate the data to the investors. <sup>434</sup> Alternatively, investors unwilling to pay a third-party service provider would have to incur the time to do that process themselves. In either scenario, the data would not be usable in as timely a manner as if it were made machine-readable in a standardized format. In addition, under a voluntary program, data that is not submitted in Inline XBRL would not be validated,thus decreasing the overall data quality of the data submitted. Unlike the machine- readable Inline XBRL format, data submitted in unstructured formats ( e.g. , HTML, ASCII) is not machine-readable at the element level and thereby cannot be validated by

EDGAR in any way. Thus, data submitted in the HTML format by affected funds that opted not to use Inline XBRL and XBRL data submitted by other affected funds could be different due to the level of pre-submission validation activities. Poor data quality reduces any data user’s ability to meaningfully analyze, aggregate, and compare data.

One commenter supported the use of Inline XBRL compared to unstructured formats, arguing that Inline XBRL data is significantly less expensive to process and more timely than unstructured data. <sup>435</sup>

As another alternative, we could have required the disclosures to be filed in a different structured format, such as the XBRL or XML format. Compared to the Inline XBRL requirement that we are adopting, using the XBRL format would entailduplicative entry, which can adversely affect the quality and usability of the structured data as well as the efficiency and cost of preparation and review of the structured data. Compared to the requirement to use Inline XBRL, the alternative of requiring affected funds to use XML could result in lower costs. However, compared to the amendments, XML would provide less flexibility in tagging complex information as well as less extensive data quality validation capabilities. Given the complexity of the information required to be tagged and its importance to investors, we believe the benefits of using Inline XBRL outweigh the higher costs compared to XML. <sup>436</sup> One commenter supported using Inline XBRL compared to XML, arguing that financial information is more efficiently reported in Inline XBRL. <sup>437</sup>

As another alternative, we could have expanded the scope of prospectus disclosure information required to be tagged in Inline XBRL under the final rule. Compared to the final rule, this alternative would improve the timeliness and usability of the required disclosure information, but would potentially impose additional costs on affected funds. To the extent that the other required prospectus disclosures of affected funds contain information that is more specific to individua l funds without sufficient comparability or aggregation utility, the benefits of having those additional required disclosures in a structured format may be lower than the more limited subset of disclosures that we are requiring affected funds to file in Inline XBRL. As anotheralternative, we could have narrowed the scope of prospectus disclosure informationrequired to be tagged in Inline XBRL under the rule. Compared to the final rule, this alternative could decrease the timeliness and usability of the information required to be disclosed, but could also potentially reduce costs for registrants. Overall, the prospectus disclosures that affected funds will be required to tag in Inline XBRL largely parallel the information that mutual funds and ETFs are required to disclose. We also believe these disclosures represent the information that will be most useful for investors that seek to use structured data to assist with investment decisions regarding affected funds.

We also are requiring issuers that file Form 24F-2 (including mutual funds and ETFs, as well as interval funds) to submit the form in a structured XML format. <sup>438</sup> We believe using a structured data format will make it easier for issuers to accurately prepare and submit the information Form 24F-2 requires and will make the submitted information more useful to Commission staff. Automated validation processes could help issuers compute registration fees accurately before submitting the filing, which could reduce administrative burdens associated with correcting inaccurate filings. A structured filing format could also facilitate pre-population of previously-filed information. We estimate the cost of tagging Form 24F-2 in a structured XML format to be $542 per fund. <sup>439</sup>

<h>3. Periodic Reporting Requirements</h>

We are adopting certain new annual report requirements for affected funds that file a short-form registration statement on Form N-2. These funds must include in their$271 per hour) per fund.annual reports certain information that they currently disclose in their prospectus—a table of fees and expenses, share price information, and a table of senior securities—and a discussion of material unresolved staff comments. <sup>440</sup> In addition, all BDCs will be required to include financial highlights in their registration statements and annualreports. <sup>441</sup> We also are requiring all registered CEFs to provide management’s discussion of fund performance in their annual reports. <sup>442</sup> Finally, registered CEFs that rely on rule 8b-16(b) under the Investment Company Act to avoid annually updating their registration statements will be required to describe in their annual reports the fund’s current investment objectives and policies, and principal risks, and to provide more expansive disclosure about certain key changes that occurred during the relevant year in enough detail to allow investors to understand each change and how it may affect the fund. <sup>443</sup> We believe these requirements will promote investor protection by making important information more readily accessible to investors.

With respect to affected funds filing short-form registration statements on Form N-2, the annual report requirements will compile certain information that is already available in a fund’s registration statement. This could be beneficial to some investors in these funds since information will be readily available in one document instead of investors needing to compile it from several sources. As previously discussed, given the ability of affected funds to use forward incorporation by reference under the short-form registration instruction, these funds’ annual reports may become a more convenient andcomprehensive source of information about a particular seasoned fund, relative to that fund’s registration statement. At the same time, the annual report requirements may increase the compliance costs for seasoned funds because new information items will have to be added to the annual report. However, because the annual report will be incorporated by reference into the fund’s prospectus, requiring disclosure in both the prospectus and annual report should not require duplicative disclosure. Moreover, specifying identical disclosure requirements in both places may facilitate forward incorporation by reference, by making clear that the same required disclosure will satisfy both requirements. Alternatively, we could have required affected funds to include in their annual reports more or less information from their registration statements. While requiring less information would reduce costs to affected funds by reducing the amount of required annual report disclosure, it could also make it more difficult for investors to find important fund information. Requiring affected funds to include more prospectus information in their annual reports could increase the length and complexity of annual reports and make them less useful to investors overall. This alternative would alsoincrease affected funds’ compliance costs.

The requirement to disclose material unresolved staff comments in the annual report is designed to mitigate the concern that other aspects of the amendments mayreduce certain affected funds’ incentives to resolve staff comments in a timely manner. We believe disclosure of material unresolved staff comments will likely provide important information to investors. This requirement may, however, impose certaincompliance costs to the extent a seasoned fund does not timely resolve staff comments and hence will be required to provide such disclosure. We do not believe these disclosure costs will be significant because the information will be readily available to the affectedfund. We recognize, however, there could be some costs to affected funds associated with compliance and legal review to the extent an affected fund wants to provide additional information in its annual report disclosure beyond that provided in the fund’s written response to the staff’s comment (which would typically already be publicly available on EDGAR). We also recognize, as some commenters suggested, that determining whether a particular comment is “material” or “unresolved” involves some subjective judgment, which may contribute to compliance and legal costs. <sup>444</sup>

With respect to the requirement that BDCs provide financial highlights information, we believe investors will benefit from disclosure summarizing a BDC’s financial statements. We believe the costs associated with this requirement should be minimal since we understand that it is general market practice for BDCs to include this information in their registration statements.

We believe the requirement for registered CEFs to include MDFP disclosure in their annual shareholder reports will be beneficial to investors by helping them assess a fund’s performance over the prior year and complementing other information in the report, which may make the annual report disclosure more understandable as a whole. This requirement will also promote parity between different types of funds, as open-end funds and BDCs are already required to provide similar disclosure in their annual reports. This requirement will likely increase compliance burdens for registered CEFs, to the extent they do not voluntarily provide MDFP disclosure already. We believe that a majority of registered CEFs already provide MDFP-like disclosure in their annualshareholder reports. We estimate the annual cost of providing MDFP disclosure to be$6,400 per registered CEF, <sup>445</sup> although this cost will likely be lower for affected funds that already provide MDFP-like disclosure.

We considered adopting additional MDFP requirements, such as requirements to:(1) disclose the impact of particular investments (including large positions and/or significant investments) or investment types that contributed to or detracted from performance; (2) explain a fund’s performance in relation to its index; (3) explain how the use of leverage affected fund performance; (4) explain the reason for and effect of any large cash or temporary defensive positions on fund performance; (5) explain the effect of any tax strategies, or the effects of taxes, on fund performance; (6) explain the effect of non-recurring or non-cash income on fund performance; (7) include general discussion of purchases and sales of fund shares and the effects of any share repurchases or tender offers on fund performance; and/or (8) disclose whether the fund has high portfolio turnover and the effect of portfolio turnover on fund performance. We also considered changing the average annual total return table to provide additional or more useful information to investors, such as requiring total return based on per-share NAV, in addition to total return based on current market price. Although one or more of these changes could result in additional, potentially helpful information for investors, we also considered the administrative costs that additional disclosure requirements would impose and have determined not to adopt them at this time.$400 = $6,400).

Under the amendments to rule 8b-16, registered CEFs relying on paragraph (b) of the rule must describe in their annual reports the fund’s current investment objectives and policies, and principal risks, and certain key changes that occurred during the relevantyear in enough detail to allow investors to understand each change and how it may affect the fund. We estimate that approximately 521 registered CEFs relied on rule 8b-16 as of December 31, 2019 and will therefore provide the new disclosure. <sup>446</sup> These registered CEFs also will be required to preface disclosure of these key changes with a legend clarifying that the disclosures provide only a summary of certain changes that have occurred in the past year, and that the summary may not reflect all of the changes that have occurred. We believe these new disclosure requirements will allow investors in funds relying on rule 8b-16(b) to more easily identify and understand key information about their investments by providing such information in one place. Because these funds are already required to disclose in their annual reports the enumerated changes to specified Form N-2 disclosure items—and therefore already must have and maintain, among other things, updated information about the investment objectives, policies and principal risks that we are requiring them to disclose in full—the new requirement will likely add only a small incremental compliance burden.

<h>4. Discretionary Amendments to Incorporation by Reference Requirements</h>

The final rule will modernize Form N-2’s requirements for backward incorporation by reference for all affected funds. <sup>447</sup> Specifically, we are requiring that an affected fund make information that is incorporated by reference into its prospectus or

SAI, as well as the corresponding prospectus and SAI, readily available and accessible on a website maintained by or for the fund and identified in the fund’s prospectus or SAI.

We believe this new requirement will improve the information’s online accessibility for investors. In particular, this new requirement will make the incorporated information, prospectus, and SAI more accessible to retail investors online because we believe they may be more inclined to look at a fund’s website for information than tosearch the EDGAR system. <sup>448</sup> We recognize that investors without home internet access, depending on their ability and preference to access fund information electronically, might experience a reduction in their ability to access information that is incorporated by reference into its prospectus or SAI. However, affected funds will also be required to provide incorporated materials upon request free of charge, in recognition that someinvestors may prefer to review these materials in paper. <sup>449</sup>

This amendment also will facilitate the efficient use of incorporation by reference by affected funds. For example, if an investor requested a copy of the affected fund’s prospectus in accordance with rule 173, the fund would in some cases need to deliver a much longer document if we did not amend Form N-2’s backward incorporation byreference provisions. <sup>450</sup> We do not, however, expect that the backward incorporation by reference amendment will substantially reduce the amount of information affected funds deliver to investors by mail or electronically. This is because we expect that most affected funds will rely on rules <sup>172</sup> and <sup>173</sup> to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligations. An issuer that uses these rules will satisfy its final prospectus delivery obligations by filing the prospectus with the Commission rather than delivering the prospectus and any incorporated material to investors. <sup>451</sup>

We do not believe the requirement to make a fund’s prospectus, SAI, andincorporated materials available on a website will generate significant compliance costs for affected funds because many funds currently post their annual and semi-annual reports and other fund information on their websites. We estimate the annual cost to comply with the website posting requirements to be $496 per fund. <sup>452</sup>

Affected funds may also incur printing and mailing costs under the final rule if some investors request paper copies of the prospectus <sup>453</sup> or of the information that has been incorporated by reference into the prospectus or SAI but not delivered with the prospectus or SAI. <sup>454</sup> In another release, the Commission estimated that the annual printing and mailing cost associated with providing copies of prospectuses and otherdocuments upon request would be approximately $500 per registrant. <sup>455</sup> We are similarly adopting a requirement to send prospectuses and related information in this release, and we have no reason to assume significant differences in the average lengths of the associated materials or the frequency of investor requests under the amendments we are adopting. We estimate that the printing and mailing costs associated with the new requirements will be approximately $750 per fund in recognition that the requirement to deliver information that has been incorporated by reference may result in greater overall costs since affected funds that are eligible to file short-form registration statements under the final rule will be able to use incorporation by reference more frequently. <sup>456</sup> Weanticipate, however, that investors may be less likely to request copies of materials that have been incorporated by reference into an affected fund’s prospectus or SAI, so we believe this requirement will only incrementally increase costs.

Alternatively, we could have retained Form N-2’s current backward incorporation by reference requirements and continued to require funds to deliver incorporated materials to new investors. Because current General Instruction F of Form N-2 does not require affected funds to make incorporated materials available online, funds would nothave to incur costs associated with website posting. However, because affected funds that choose to rely on rules <sup>172</sup> and <sup>173</sup> will be deemed to have delivered their disclosures upon filing with the Commission instead of giving them to investors, the currentbackward incorporation delivery requirement will not result in delivery of incorporated materials to a fund’s investors, thus making less accessible the disclosure materials that might affect their investment decision.

We are also modifying Form N-14 to decrease the disclosure burden of the form and reduce the length of Form N-14 prospectuses in certain circumstances. <sup>457</sup> The amendments will allow BDCs to incorporate by reference to the same extent as registered CEFs. This will provide for more consistent treatment between registered CEFs and BDCs. We also are eliminating the requirement that registrants file with the Form N-14 registration statement the documents containing the information that is incorporated byreference into the prospectus or SAI, thus decreasing compliance costs. Commentersgenerally supported these changes. <sup>458</sup>

<h>5. Automatic or Immediate Effectiveness of Filings by Affected Funds Conducting Certain Continuous Offerings</h>

In response to comments, the final rule will allow any registered CEF or BDC that conducts continuous offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(ix) to file post-effective amendments and certain registration statements that become effective immediately upon filing or automatically <sup>60</sup> days after filing. <sup>459</sup> We believe this rule amendment will allow these unlisted continuously-offered affected funds to maintain effective registration statements in a more efficient, cost-effective manner, similar to the benefits the final rule provides to affected funds that file short-form registration statements or qualify as WKSIs. Under the amendments, continuously-offered unlisted affected funds, which generally will notqualify as WKSIs or be eligible to file short-form registration statements because they do not have public float, will be able to more efficiently update their financial statements under section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act to maintain effective registration statements while they engage in continuous offerings. One commenter stated that allowing continuously-offered unlisted affected funds to rely on rule <sup>486</sup> would benefit investors in these funds by allowing the funds to avoid the time and expense of an annual staffreview of registration statements where no changes are made beyond immaterial updates and updates to audited financial information. <sup>460</sup>

As an alternative, we could have continued to limit rule <sup>486</sup> to interval funds. Such an alternative would have made it less efficient for certain continuously-offered unlisted affected funds to update their financial statements or make other changes to their registration statements relative to the processes available to all other funds that conduct continuous or delayed offerings under the Commission’s rules.

<h>IV. PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT ANALYSIS</h>

<h>A. Background</h>

Certain provisions of the final amendments contain “collection of information” requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of <sup>1995</sup> (PRA). <sup>461</sup> We are submitting the final amendments to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review in accordance with <sup>44</sup> U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11. The hours and costs associated with preparing disclosure, filing forms, and retaining records constitute reporting and cost burdens imposed by the collections of information. An agency may notconduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control number. The titles for the collection of information are summarized in Table <sup>5</sup> below.

TABLE 5 : COLLECTIONS OF INFORMATION

Notes:

1. Recently, we issued a release that, among other things, retitled this collection of information (previously, “ Mutual Fund Interactive Data”) “ Investment Company Interactive Data.” See Variable Contract Summary Prospectus Adopting Release, supra footnote

2. T he paperwork burdens for the rules under section 8(b) of the Investment Company Act are imposed through the forms and reportsthat are subject to the requirements in these rules and are reflected in the PRA burdens of those documents. To avoid a PRA inventory reflecting duplicative burdens and for administrative convenience, we assign a one-hour burden to these rules.

The rules, forms, and regulations listed above were adopted under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or the Investment Company Act. They set forth the disclosure requirements for registration statements, prospectuses, periodic reports, and certified shareholder reports that are prepared by registrants to help investors make informed investment and voting decisions. They also permit additional communications by registrants during a registered offering. The final amendments will allow affected funds to use the securities offering rules that are already available to operating companies. Inaddition, the final rule includes amendments to our rules and forms intended to tailor the disclosure and regulatory framework to affected funds.

The Investment Company Interactive Data collection of information references current requirements for certain registered investment companies to submit to the Commission information included in their registration statements, or information included in or amended by any post-effective amendments to such registrationstatements, in response to certain form items in interactive data format. It also references the requirement for funds to submit an Interactive Data File to the Commission for any form of prospectus filed pursuant to rule 497(c) or (e) that includes information in response to certain form items. The final amendment will include several new structured data requirements, including requirements for: (1) BDCs to submit financial statement information using Inline XBRL format; (2) affected funds to include structured cover page information in their registration statements on Form N-2 using Inline XBRL format; and (3) affected funds to tag certain prospectus information using Inline XBRL format. <sup>462</sup> Although the interactive data filing requirements are included in the Form N-2instructions, we are separately reflecting the hour and cost burdens for these requirements in the burden estimate for Investment Company Interactive Data and not in the estimate for Form N-2.

The information collection requirements related to registration statements and Exchange Act reports are mandatory. In addition, there is no mandatory retention period for the information disclosed, and the information gathered will be made publiclyavailable. The information collection requirements related to the communications and prospectus delivery rules we are adopting apply only to affected funds and other offering participants choosing to rely on them. There will be a mandatory record retention period with respect to the communications and prospectus delivery information collections.

Under rule 433, issuers and offering participants must retain all free writing prospectuses that have been used, for three years following the date of the initial bona fide offering of the securities in question that were not filed with the Commission. Moreover, free writing prospectuses that are made by or on behalf of an affected fund, and free writing prospectuses that are broadly disseminated by another offering participant, will have to be filed and will be publicly available on EDGAR, whereas free writing prospectusesprepared by or on behalf of, or used or referred to, by offering participants other than the issuer will not have to be filed.

<h>B. Summary of the Ame ndme nts and Impact on Information Colle ctions</h>

We are amending several rules and forms to modify the registration, communications, and offering processes for affected funds under the Securities Act and Investment Company Act. The amendments are designed to carry out the requirements of section <sup>803</sup> of the BDC Act and section <sup>509</sup> of the Registered CEF Act. The amendments generally will allow affected funds to use the securities offering rules that are already available to operating companies.

The amendments principally affect five aspects of the application of our securitiesoffering rules to affected funds. First, the amendments will streamline the registration process under the Securities Act for affected funds to allow them to sell securities more quickly and efficiently under a shelf registration process tailored to affected funds.

Second, the amendments will allow affected funds to qualify as WKSIs under rule 405under the Securities Act. Third, the amendments will allow affected funds to satisfy final prospectus delivery requirements using the same method as operating companies. Fourth, the amendments will allow affected funds to use communications rules currently available to operating companies, such as the use of the safe harbors for disseminating certain factual business information, forward-looking information, a “free writing prospectus,” and broker-dealer research reports. Finally, the amendments will tailor affected funds’ disclosure and regulatory framework in light of the amendments to the offering rules applicable to them. These amendments include new structured data requirements, new disclosure requirements for annual reports, and a requirement for interval funds to pay securities registration fees using the same method that mutual funds and ETFs use today.

We anticipate that several provisions of the amendments will increase the burdens and costs for affected funds that will be subject to the amendments. We have estimated the average number of hours an affected fund will spend to prepare and file the information collections and the average hourly rate for the services of outside professionals. In deriving our estimates, we recognize that the burdens will likely vary among individual affected funds based on a number of factors, including their size and the nature of their investment activities. <sup>463</sup> In addition, some affected funds mayexperience costs in excess of our estimates, and some may experience less than the estimated average costs.

In addition to these amendments relating to affected funds, we are amending several rules and forms to enable certain ETPs that are not registered under the

Investment Company Act to elect to register offerings of an indeterminate amount of exchange-traded vehicle securities and pay registration fees for these offerings on an annual net basis. We have estimated the average number of additional hours that such ETPs will spend when filing registration statements for these offerings to prepare and file the information collections and the average hourly rate for the services of outsideprofessionals. We anticipate that the amendments will result in a decrease in the number of registration statements filed by these issuers and that, overall, these amendments will reduce the burdens and costs for these issuers.

<h>1. Amendments to Form N-2 Registration Statement</h>

Form N-2 is the form used by an affected fund to register offerings under the Securities Act and, as applicable, to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

The amendments to Form N-2 will increase the existing disclosure burdens of the form by requiring:

Affected funds to use new check boxes on the cover page to provide information about the fund, the purpose of the filing, and the type of offering, including whether the form is being used for automatic shelf registration; <sup>464</sup>

BDCs to include financial highlights disclosure in their registration statements, as registered CEFs are currently required to do; <sup>465</sup>

Affected funds to provide new undertakings to be furnished in registration statements being filed pursuant to rule 415; <sup>466</sup> and

Affected funds to make certain documents available online if they incorporate them by reference, including the prospectus, SAI, and any Exchange Act reports filed under section 13 or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference into the fund’s prospectus or SAI. <sup>467</sup>

At the same time, the amendments to Form N-2 will decrease existing burdens for the form by:

Permitting eligible affected funds to forward incorporate by reference Exchange

Act reports, which will reduce the need for such funds to file a post-effective amendment or a prospectus supplement to update information in the registration statement. <sup>468</sup>

TABLE 8 : FINAL FORM N– 2 PRA ESTIMATES

Table 6 above summarizes the current PRA estimates associated with the requirements of Form N-2. Table 7 summarized the proposed PRA estimates included in the Proposing Release. <sup>469</sup> Table <sup>8</sup> summarizes the final PRA estimates associated with Form N-2 as amended. We did not receive public comment on our proposed PRA estimates, but we are revising our estimates as a result of updated industry data.

Specifically, we are revising the estimated wage rates, the estimated number of affected funds, and the estimated number of annual initial registration statement and post-effective amendment filings to reflect updated industry data.

As summarized in Table <sup>8</sup> above, we estimate that the total hour burdens and time costs associated with Form N-2 will be an aggregate annual burden of 94,350 hours at an aggregate annual cost of internal burden of $25,371,886. We estimate an aggregate annual external time cost of $6,269,752.2. Structured Data Reporting Requirements

We are amending Form N-2, as well as Regulation S-K and Regulation S-T, <sup>470</sup> to require certain new structured data reporting requirements for registered CEFs and BDCs. <sup>471</sup> Specifically, the amendments will require:

BDCs to submit financial statement information using Inline XBRL format, as is currently required of operating companies. <sup>472</sup> The respondents for this collection of information are an estimated <sup>105</sup> BDCs.

Affected funds to include structured cover page information in their registration statements on Form N-2 using Inline XBRL, including the tagging of the newcheck boxes to the cover page of Form N-2. <sup>473</sup> The respondents for this collection of information are an estimated <sup>791</sup> affected funds. As demonstrated in Table <sup>9</sup> below, we do not believe the cover page tagging requirement will result in significant additional burdens for affected funds.

Affected funds to tag certain Form N-2 disclosure items using Inline XBRL. <sup>474</sup> The respondents for this collection of information are an estimated <sup>791</sup> affected funds.

The purposes of these information collections are to make financial information easier for investors to analyze and to help automate regulatory filings and business information processing, and to reduce the current disparity between operating companies and BDCs with respect to the accessibility of information they provide to the market.

These collections of information are mandatory for the relevant respondents, discussed for each collection below. Confidential information will not be disclosed pursuant to these new reporting requirements.

Securities Table; Investment Objectives and Policies; Risk Factors; Share Price Data; and Capital Stock, Long-Term Debt, and Other Securities.

A seasoned fund filing a short-form registration statement on Form N-2 also will be required to tag any information that is incorporated by reference from an Exchange Act report, such as those on Form N-CSR, 10-K, 10-Q, or 8-K, in response to a disclosure item of the registration statement that is required to be tagged. See supra footnote <sup>241</sup> and accompanying text.

TABLE 9 : PROPOSED AND FINAL STRUCTURED DATA REPORTING PRA ANALYSIS

Notes:

1. Includes initial and ongoing burden estimates annualized over a three-year period. Here, as discussed in the Proposing Release, supra footnote at section V.B.2, we assumed that the one-time cost would result in a 50% incremental increase in the internal burdens and external costs of the BDC financial information and Form N-2 disclosure requirements (items I and III in the chart above) during the first year, and would subsequently decline in the second and third years by 75% from the immediately-preceding year.

2. The proposed estimates are discussed in additional detail in the Proposing Release, supra footnote at section V.B.2.

Table 9 summarizes the proposed PRA estimates included in the Proposing

Release and the final PRA estimates for the structured data reporting requirements. We did not receive public comment on our proposed PRA estimates, but we are revising our estimates as a result of updated industry data. Specifically, we are revising the estimated number of BDCs and affected funds to reflect updated industry data.

As summarized in Table 9, we estimate that the total hour burdens and time costs associated with the structured data reporting requirements will be an aggregate annual burden of 45,659 hours. We estimate an aggregate annual external time cost of$4,736,303.

<h>3. New Annual Reporting Requirements under Rule 30e-1 and Exchange Act Periodic Reporting Requirements for BDCs</h>

Several of the amendments, such as the amendments that would allow certainaffected funds to use an automatic shelf registration statement or to forward incorporate by reference Exchange Act reports, may raise the importance of an affected fund’s Exchange Act reports to investors. <sup>475</sup> In light of this, we are adopting new disclosure requirements for affected funds’ annual reports. Specifically, we are amending:

Form N-2 to require affected funds using the short-form registration statement to disclose in their annual reports a fee and expense table, share price data, a seniorsecurities table, and unresolved staff comments regarding the fund’s periodic or current reports or registration statement; <sup>476</sup>

Form N-2 to require registered CEFs to provide MDFP in their annual reports; <sup>477</sup>

Form N-2 to require BDCs to include financial highlights in their annual reports on Form 10-K; <sup>478</sup> and

Rule 8b-16 to require a registered CEF that relies on paragraph (b) of that rule to describe in its annual reports its current investment objectives and policies, and principal risks, and certain key changes that occurred during the relevant year in enough detail to allow investors to understand each change and how it may affectthe fund. <sup>479</sup>

The collection of information burdens under these amendments correspond to information collections under rule 30e-1 for registered CEFs and Form 10-K for BDCs.

Rule 30e-1 generally requires registered investment companies to transmit to theirshareholders, at least semi-annually, reports containing the information that is required to be included in such reports by the fund’s registration statement form under the Investment Company Act. BDCs, like operating companies, are required to file annual reports on Form 10-K pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

The burden estimates were calculated by multiplying the estimated number of responses by the estimated average amount of time it would take an affected fund toprepare and review disclosure required under the amendments. For purposes of the PRA, the burden is allocated between internal burden hours and outside professional costs. For these purposes, we estimate that 75% of the burden of preparing annual reports under rule 30e-1 and on Form 10-K is undertaken by the fund internally, while 25% of this burden is undertaken by outside professionals, such as outside counsel and independent auditors, retained by the fund at an average cost of $400 per hour. <sup>480</sup>

TABLE 10 : RU LE 30E-1 INCREMENTAL BURDEN ESTIMATES

Table <sup>10</sup> summarizes the proposed incremental PRA burden estimates and the final incremental PRA burden estimates associated with the new annual report requirements for registered CEFs. We did not receive comments on our proposed estimates, but we have revised them as a result of updated industry data and changes to the proposed amendments. Specifically, we are revising the estimated number ofregistered CEFs that will be subject to the new annual report requirements to reflect updated industry data and the estimated burden hours associated with the amendments to rule 8b-16(b). As summarized in Table <sup>10</sup> above, the revised additional burdens associated with the new annual report requirements for registered CEFs for purposes of the rule 30e-1 collection of information is 11,210 hours for internal time and external costs of $1,494,400.

2. Revised to reflect updated industry data.

Table <sup>11</sup> summarizes the proposed incremental PRA burden estimates and the final incremental PRA burden estimates associated with the new annual report requirements for BDCs. We did not receive comments on our proposed estimates, but we have revised them as a result of updated industry data. Specifically, we are revising the estimated number of BDCs that will be subject to the new annual report requirements to reflect updated industry data. As summarized in Table <sup>11</sup> above, the revised additional burdens associated with the new annual report requirements for BDCs for purposes of the Form 10-K collection of information is <sup>218</sup> hours for internal time and external costs of$29,200.

TABLE 12 : REQUESTED PAPERWORK BURDEN UNDER THE AMENDMENTS TO ANNUAL REPORT DISCLOSURE

N otes:

1. The rule 30e-1 estimates are based on the last time the rule’s information collections were approved, pursuant to a submission for a PRA extension in 2019. The Form 10-K estimates are based on the last time the form’s information collections were approved, pursuant to a submission for a PRA extension in 2019.

2. As reflected in and the number of registered CEFs and the number of BDCs that will need to comply with the new annual report disclosure requirements will vary depending on the type of new disclosure, although all registered CEFs (686) and all BDCs (105) will be required to provide some additional annual report disclosure.

As summarized above in Table 12, the revised aggregate estimates, including the new amendments, for rule 30e-1 are 1,039,868 hours and $149,244,791 in external costs. The revised aggregate estimates for Form 10-K, including the new amendments, are 14,198,998 hours and $1,895,253,919 in external costs.4. Securities Offering Communications

Rule 163 permits WKSIs to make unrestricted oral and written offers before filing a registration statement, but any written offer will be considered a free writing prospectus and will generally have to be filed upon filing a registration statement or amendment covering the securities. Rule <sup>433</sup> governs the use of free writing prospectuses by WKSIs and non-WKSI issuers after the filing of a registration statement. A free writing prospectus used by or on behalf of an affected fund, or free writing prospectuses that are broadly disseminated by another offering participant, are required to be filed with the Commission. We have adopted amendments to rules <sup>163</sup> and <sup>433</sup> that will permit affected funds to rely on these rules to use a free writing prospectus.

We did not receive public comment on our proposed estimates, but we have revised them as a result of updated industry data. Specifically, we are revising theestimated number of firms that will be subject to the rule to reflect updated industry data.

The burden estimates were calculated by multiplying the estimated number of responses by the estimated average amount of time it would take a registrant to prepare and review disclosure required under the proposed amendments. For purposes of the PRA, the burden is to be allocated between internal burden hours and outsideprofessional costs. Table 13 below sets forth the percentage estimates we typically use forthe burden allocation for each rule. <sup>481</sup> We also estimate that the average cost of retaining outside professional to be $400 per hour. <sup>482</sup>

TABLE 13 : Standard Estimated Burden Allocation for Securities Act Rules 163 and 433.

The table below illustrates the incremental change to the total annual compliance burden of affected rules, in hours and costs, as a result of the proposed amendments.

Increase in Professional Costs for Current Affect Responses (F)= (E) x$400

Notes:

1. For a number of reasons, many issuers that are currently eligible to be WKSIs do not make use of free writing prospectuses in reliance on rule 163. At the time the Commission adopted rule 163, it estimated that 53 free writing prospectuses would be filed under rule 163 per year. However, during the Commission’s 2017 fiscal year, only 10 free writing prospectuses in reliance on rule 163 were filed with the Commission. We estimate that 100 affected funds would be eligible to be WKSIs. See supra section . If current practices regarding the use of free writing prospectuses under rule 163 continue with respect to affected funds, we do not believe that these affected funds would significantly increase the number of free writing prospectuses under rule 163. Accordingly, we estimate that, on average, affected funds that are eligible to be WKSIs would file 2 free writing prospectuses under the amendments to rule 163 each year.

2. The most recent data that we have available shows that each operating company files an average of approximately 5.4 free writing prospectuses per year in reliance on rule 433. We estimate that there will be 791 affected funds filing approximately 4,271 free writing prospectuses. See supra section .

3. The burden hour estimates for rules 163 and 433 are based on the last time the rules’ information collections were approved, pursuant to a submission for a PRA extension in 2017. The conditions under rule 433 to use a free writing prospectus, require a free writing prospectus to contain more information and contribute to the greater burden hour than for a rule 163 free writing prospectus.

The following table summarizes the requested paperwork burden, including the estimated total reporting burdens and costs, under the proposed amendments.

TABLE 15 : Requested Paperwork Burden under the Amendments to Securities Act Rules163 and 433.

As summarized above in Table 15, the revised aggregate estimates, including the new amendments, for rule 163 are 1.125 hours, and $870 in external costs. The revisedaggregate estimates for rule 433, including the new amendments, are 6,391 hours and$7,669,017 in external costs.5. Prospectus Delivery Requirements

Rule 173 requires the delivery of a copy of a final prospectus, or in lieu of a final prospectus, a notice to purchasers stating that a sale of securities was made based on a registration statement or in a transaction in which a final prospectus would have been required to have been delivered in the absence of rule 172. <sup>483</sup> We have adoptedamendments to rule 173 to remove the exclusion for offerings of affected funds. <sup>484</sup>

We did not receive public comment on our proposed PRA estimates for rule 173. We have revised our estimates regarding the number of funds likely to rely on rule 173, and to reflect updated industry data. <sup>485</sup> Specifically, based on a review of Form N-2 filings made with the Commission, we are revising downward the proposed estimate of the number of affected funds expected to rely on rule <sup>173</sup> as a result of the amendments, and thus incur burdens associated with the rule.

The burden estimates were calculated by multiplying the estimated number of registrants likely to rely on rule 173 by the number of responses per registrant by the estimated time it would take compile the necessary information and data, prepare andreview disclosure, file documents and retain records for issuers that choose to rely on rule173. We assume, similar to operating companies that rely on rule 173, that each affectedfund will incur 100% of the burden. The table below illustrates the incremental change to the total annual burden for affected funds as a result of the amendments.

TABLE <sup>16</sup> : RULE <sup>173</sup> ( Calculation of the Incremental Change in Burden Estimates of Current Responses Resulting from the Amendme nts)

N otes:

1. In the Proposing Release we estimated that all 807 affected funds would rely on rule 173. See supra footnote at section

V.B.5. However, because only a fund with an effective Securities Act registration statement may rely on rule 173, we are revising our estimates. Based on our staff’s review of Form N-2 Securities Act registration statements filed annually between <sup>2017</sup> and 2019, we estimate 382 annual filings, each by a different affected fund. We estimate that each such fund will provide 43,546 responses annually, for a total of 16,634,572 annual responses per year (382 funds x 43,546 responses annually = 16,634,572).

2. The estimated burden hour per response of 0.0167 hours derives from the most recently-approved rule 173 PRA submission (2017).

The following table summarizes the total PRA burden, including the estimated total reporting burdens and costs, for rule <sup>173</sup> as a result of the amendments. As reflected below, the revised aggregate hourly burden associated with rule <sup>173</sup> as a result of the amendments is 4,159,688 internal burden hours, with no external costs.

TABLE 17 : RULE 173 ( Requested Paperwork Burden under the Amendments)

Rule 24f-2 requires any open-end management company, unit investment trust, or face-amount certificate company deemed to have registered an indefinite amount of securities to file a Form 24F-2 not later than <sup>90</sup> days after the end of any fiscal year in which it has publicly offered such securities. Form 24F-2 is the annual notice of securities sold by these funds that accompanies the payment of registration fees with respect to the securities sold during the fiscal year, net of securities redeemed or repurchased during the year. We are amending rules 23c-3 and 24f-2 so that interval funds will pay registration fees on the same annual basis using Form 24F-2. We are also adopting a requirement that funds submit reports on Form 24F-2 in an XML structured data format.6. Form 24F-2

TABLE 18 : FORM 24F-2 PRA ESTIMATES

Notes:

2. This estimate was previously submitted to OMB in connection with the renewal of approval for the collection of information required by Form 24F-2 in 2018.

3. Proposing Release, supra footnote at section IV.B.7.

4. Estimate revised to reflect updated data. Based on a review of Form 24F-2 filings for the period 2017-2019, the staff estimates that 6,741 filings will be made annually, and that 53 interval funds (representing the 3-year average of interval funds registered with the Commission) will file Form 24F-2 as a result of the final amendments (6,741 + 53 = 6,794).

Table 18 above summarizes the current PRA estimates, the proposed PRAestimates, and the final PRA estimates associated with the requirement to file reports on Form 24F-2. <sup>486</sup> We did not receive public comment on our proposed estimates, but we have revised them as a result of updated industry data. Specifically, we are revising the estimated wage rates and estimated number of funds that will be subject to the requirements of Form 24F-2 to reflect updated industry data. As summarized in Table <sup>18</sup> above, the revised aggregate estimates for Form 24F-2, including the new amendments, are 27,176 hours, with no external costs.

<h>7. Amendments Permitting the Registration of Offerings of an Indeterminate Number of Exchange-Traded Vehicle Securities and the Payment of Registration Fees for Such Offerings on an Annual Net Basis</h>

The amendments to certain Securities Act rules and to Forms S-1, S-3, F-1 and F-3 will allow issuers of exchange-traded vehicle securities to elect to register offeringsof an indeterminate number of such securities and pay registration fees for these offerings on an annual net basis. We estimate that the amendments will increase the paperwork burden for registration statements on Form S-1 and Form S-3 for such offerings due to the requirement to calculate and pay registration fees on an annual net basis within <sup>90</sup>days after the end of the fiscal year. <sup>487</sup> However, because these issuers will have the ability to elect to register offerings of an indeterminate number of such securities, we also estimate that the amendments will result in a decrease in the number of registrationstatements on these forms filed by these issuers and that, overall, the amendments willreduce the paperwork burdens associated with Form S-1 and Form S-3. The amendments to Forms F-1 and F-3 are not expected to affect the burdens associated with those forms, in that we do not anticipate that any issuers at this time will use Form F-1 or Form F-3 to register offerings of an indeterminate number of exchange-traded vehicle securities and pay registration fees for these offerings on an annual net basis.

Based on a review of registration statements filed by ETPs for the period 2017- 2019, the staff estimates that, after the effectiveness of these amendments, an average of five registration statements on each of Form S-1 and Form S-3 will be filed each year for offerings of an indeterminate number of exchange-traded vehicle securities with the payment of registration fees on an annual net basis. <sup>488</sup> We estimate that the incremental increase in burden for these registration statements will be two hours, consistent with the estimated burden for Form 24F-2. We would expect there to be only a minimal initial burden of establishing a system for calculating fee payments in this manner, in that these issuers already track the issuances and redemptions of their securities on an ongoing basis. When paying registration fees, these issuers will file prospectus supplements under rule <sup>424</sup> and provide disclosures modeled after Form 24F-2. We estimate that, in filing these prospectus supplements in connection with registration statements on Form S-1 or Form S-3, 25% of the burden of preparation is carried by the issuer internally and that75% of the burden of preparation is carried by outside professionals retained by the issuer at an average cost of $400 per hour.

TABLE 19. INCREMENTAL PAPERWORK BURDEN UNDER THE AMENDMENTS FOR

REGISTRATION STATEMENTS

In addition, we estimate that seven fewer Forms S-1 and ten fewer Forms S-3 will be filed by these issuers each year as a result of the ability to register offerings of an indeterminate number of exchange-traded vehicle securities, which could result in lower costs for these issuers through a reduction in the number of registration statements filed by these issuers.

<h>8. Amendments to Form N-14</h>

Form N-14 is the form used by an affected fund for the registration of securities issued in business combination transactions. The amendments to Form N-14 will decrease the existing disclosure burden of the form by allowing BDCs to incorporate by reference to the same extent as is currently permitted for registered CEFs and eliminating the requirement for affected funds to file with the Form N-14 registration statement the documents that contain the information that is incorporated by reference into the prospectus or SAI. <sup>489</sup>

Table <sup>22</sup> above summarizes the current PRA estimates associated with the requirements of Form N-14. Table <sup>23</sup> summarizes the final PRA amendments associated with Form N-14 as amended. We are revising our estimates as a result of updated industry data and modifications from the proposal. Specifically, we are deducting <sup>10</sup> hours of internal burden per filing to reflect the burden reduction associated with the incorporation by reference amendments affecting filings on Form N-14. In addition, we are revising the estimated wage rates to reflect updated industry data. As summarized in Table <sup>23</sup> above, we estimate that the total hour burdens and time costs associated with Form N-14 will be an aggregate burden of 125,260 hours at an aggregate annual cost of internal burden of $37,856,382. We estimate an aggregate annual external time cost of$5,842,000.

<h>V. FINAL REGULATORY FLEXIB ILITY ANALYSIS</h>

The Commission has prepared the following Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“FRFA”) in accordance with section 4(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”), <sup>490</sup> regarding the final rule modifications to the registration, communications, and offering processes for affected funds under the Securities Act and the rules and forms under the Exchange Act and Investment Company Act, that will allow affected funds to use the securities offering rules thatare already available to operating companies. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis(“IRFA”) was prepared in accordance with the RFA and is included in the Proposing Release. <sup>491</sup>

<h>A. Need and Obje ctives of the Final Rule</h>

The BDC Act directs us to allow a BDC to use the securities offering rules that are available to other issuers required to file reports under section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the

Exchange Act and specifically enumerates the required revisions. Similarly, the Registered CEF Act directs us to allow any listed registered CEF or interval fund to use the securities offering rules that are available to other issuers that are required to file reports under section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, subject to appropriate conditions. <sup>492</sup> Pursuant to both Acts, the final rule will modify the registration, communications, and offering processes for affected funds to allow them to use the securities offering rules that are available to other issuers required to file reports under section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. We are also adopting amendments to our rules and forms, to tailor the disclosure and regulatory framework for affected funds, in light of the amendments to the offering rules applicable to them. The reasons for, and objectives of, the final rule are further discussed in more detail in Section II above. The costs and burdens of these requirements on smaller affected funds are discussed below as well as above in our Economic Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis, which discusses the costs and burdens of the final rule on all affected funds.

<h>B. Significant Issues Raised by Public Comme nts</h>

In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on every aspect of the IRFA, including the number of small entities that would be affected by the proposed rule and form amendments, the existence or nature of the potential impact of the proposals on small entities discussed in the analysis, and how to quantify the impact of the proposed amendments. We also requested comment on the proposed compliance burdens and the effect these burdens would have on smaller entities. Although we did not receive comments specifically addressing the IRFA,several commenters stated in their comment letters the impact they believed certain aspects of the proposed amendments would have on small affected funds. <sup>493</sup> Specifically, one commenter stated that the proposed rules would disadvantage smaller affected funds relative to larger affected funds that have obtained WKSI status, because smaller funds that would benefit from the ability to use automatic effective registration statements to quickly come to market during periods when their shares trade at a premium, may miss the opportunity to raise capital that the proposed rules were designed to facilitate. The commenter stated that this disparity wasunnecessary because shareholders of smaller funds would not likely be disadvantaged by a lower level of market commentary about those funds as compared to larger funds given the investor protections afforded to those shareholders by the Investment Company Act. <sup>494</sup> Similarly, another commenter stated that the Commission should reconsider the public float requirement in order to encourage new CEF issuances and give smaller CEFs the opportunity to grow through the issuance of additional shares, because the offering size of most of the recent offerings by public CEFs have been relatively small, making them ineligible for treatment as a “seasoned fund” or WKSI. <sup>495</sup> The second commenter stated that forward incorporation by reference, which is allowed when an affected fund has met the requirements to use a short-form registration statement, should be made available to smaller affected funds. <sup>496</sup> However, as discussed below, commenters defined smaller funds as those funds that did not meet the WKSI public floatthreshold of $700 million or more for purposes of using an automatic registration statement, or did not meet the seasoned public float threshold of $75 million or more for purposes of forward incorporation by reference.

Another commenter voiced support for the XBRL format proposed for certain filings by affected funds and recommended expanded use of the format for other disclosures. <sup>497</sup> The commenter noted that a study it conducted along with the AICPA in <sup>2014</sup> and again in <sup>2017</sup> evaluating the annual cost of XBRL preparation for small reporting companies had decreased from $10,000 in <sup>2014</sup> to $5,500 in 2017. <sup>498</sup> In citing to the Council of Institutional Investors (CII) July 19, 2018 comment letter in response to the SEC Draft Strategic Plan 2018-2022, the commenter stated that inline XBRL is an improvement to EDGAR functionality and makes disclosure documents more valuable and cost-effective for a broad range of users including market analysts and data vendors that conduct research on smaller companies. <sup>499</sup> In response to the Commission’s request for comment regarding whether the current burdens of preparing financial statements and notes in XBRL format have changed over time for small reportingcompanies, the commenter reiterated that the cost of XBRL preparation has declined 45% for small reporting companies. <sup>500</sup>

After considering the comments we received on the proposed rule and form amendments, we are adopting the amendments, substantially as proposed, with two modifications intended to reduce the operational challenges commenters identified. Specifically, we are expanding thescope of rule <sup>486</sup> to any registered CEF or BDC conducting continuous offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(ix), and we are not adopting our proposed amendments to Form 8-K. <sup>501</sup> However, we do not believe there would be any meaningful reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliancecosts associated with these modifications that would impact small entities.

<h>C. Small Entitie s Subje ct to the Rule</h>

An investment company is a small entity if, together with other investment companies in the same group of related investment companies, it has net assets of $50 million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal year. <sup>502</sup> Commission staff estimates that, as of June 2019, <sup>16</sup> BDCs and <sup>33</sup> registered CEFs are small entities . <sup>503</sup>

A broker-dealer is a small entity if it has total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the prior fiscal year as of which its auditedfinancial statements were prepared pursuant to 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d) (Exchange Act rule 17a-

Based on data as of June 2019 from Morningstar Direct, Forms 10-K and 10-Q that are filed with the Commission by BDCs, and closed-end fund data reported on Forms N-CSR, N-Q, and N- PORT filed with the Commission, we estimate, of the 16 BDCs that are small entities, <sup>3</sup> were traded on an exchange with market capitalization below the $75 million public float threshold for qualifying to file a short-form registration statement on Form N-2, and 5 small BDCs traded on the over-the-counter (OTC) market with market capitalization below this same $75 million threshold. Likewise, of the 33 registered CEFs that qualified as small entities, 4 traded on an exchange with market capitalizations below this same $75 million threshold; while <sup>3</sup> were traded on the OTC market with market capitalizations below $75 million.5), <sup>504</sup> and it is not affiliated with any person (other than a natural person) that is not a small business or small organization. <sup>505</sup> Commission staff estimates that, as of June 30, 2019, there are approximately 942 broker-dealers that may be considered small entities. <sup>506</sup> To the extent a small broker-dealer participates in a securities offering or prepares research reports, it may be affected by the final rule. Generally, we believe larger broker-dealers engage in these activities, and we did not receive comments on whether or how the proposed amendments to rule <sup>138</sup> affect small broker-dealers. <sup>507</sup>

The final rule will also affect ETPs, permitting them to register offerings of an indeterminate number of exchange-traded vehicle securities and pay registration fees for such offerings on an annual net basis. For purposes of the RFA, 17 CFR 230.157 (Securities Act rule157) defines an issuer, other than an investment company, to be a “small business” or “small organization” if it had total assets of $5 million or less on the last day of its most recent fiscal year and is engaged or proposing to engage in an offering of securities not exceeding $5million. <sup>508</sup> Exchange Act rule 0-10(a) defines an issuer, other than an investment company, to be a “small business” or “small organization” if it had total assets of $5 million or less on the lastday of its most recent fiscal year. Commission staff estimates that, as of February 2020, there are approximately 7 ETPs that are issuers, other than an investment company, that may beconsidered small entities. <sup>509</sup>

<h>D. Projected Re porting, Recordkeeping, and Othe r Compliance Re quire me nts</h>

The final rule will create, amend, or eliminate current requirements for affected funds and broker-dealers, including those that are small entities discussed in section V.C above. <sup>510</sup>

<h>1. Registration Process and Final Prospectus Delivery</h>

The amendments to the registration process for affected funds will create a short-form registration statement on Form N-2 that will function like a registration statement filed on Form S-3. <sup>511</sup> An affected fund eligible to file the short-form registration statement can use it to register shelf offerings, including shelf registration statements (filed by a WKSI) that become effectiveautomatically. <sup>512</sup> Such a fund also can satisfy Form N-2’s disclosure requirement by incorporating by reference information from the fund’s Exchange Act reports. <sup>513</sup>

In addition, the final rule will allow certain affected funds eligible to register a primary offering under the adopted short-form registration instruction to rely on rule 430B to omit information from their base prospectuses, and to permit affected funds to use the process operating companies follow to file prospectus supplements. <sup>514</sup> Affected funds that choose to forward incorporate information by reference into their registration statements will also be able to include additional information in their periodic reports that is not required to be included in these reports in order to update their registration statements. <sup>515</sup>

The amendments to the WKSI definition in rule <sup>405</sup> will also permit affected funds to qualify for enhanced offering and communication benefits under our rules. <sup>516</sup> In order for an issuer to qualify as a WKSI, the issuer must meet the registrant requirements of Form S-3, i.e. , it must be “seasoned,” and generally must have at least $700 million in public float. <sup>517</sup> Qualifying as a WKSI will allow such funds to file a registration statement or amendment that becomes effective automatically in a broader variety of contexts than non-WKSIs, and to communicate at any time, including through a free writing prospectus, without violating the “gun-jumping” provisions of the Securities Act. <sup>518</sup>

Smaller affected funds will not be able to avail themselves of the aspects of the adopted rule amendments streamlining the registration process for affected funds or that make available the WKSI designation to affected funds. The adopted short-form registration instruction isdesigned to provide affected funds parity with operating companies by permitting them to use the instruction to register the same transactions that an operating company can register on Form S-3. <sup>519</sup> In order to qualify to use the short-form registration statement under Form N-2, General Instruction A.2 of Form N-2 generally requires an affected fund to meet the public float requirement of $75 million under the transaction requirements for Form S-3. <sup>520</sup> Likewise, the WKSI provision of rule <sup>405</sup> contains a public float requirement of $700 million, as discussed above. Smaller funds will not generally meet the public float thresholds to file a short-form registration statement or qualify as a WKSI and therefore will not generally be subject to either of these amendments. <sup>521</sup> However, smaller affected funds may be affected by these amendments in other ways. For example, smaller affected funds may be more likely to merge to obtain WKSI status, and could experience competitive disadvantages compared to larger funds that qualify as WKSIs or that file short-form registration statements on Form N-2. <sup>522</sup>

The final rule will also apply the delivery method for operating company final prospectuses to offerings of affected funds. As a result, an affected fund, broker, or dealer will be allowed to satisfy the final prospectus delivery obligations if a final prospectus is or will be on file with the Commission within the time required by the rules and other conditions aresatisfied. <sup>523</sup> These requirements will apply to all affected funds, as well as all brokers or dealers. <sup>524</sup>

<h>2. Communications Rules</h>

For offerings of smaller affected funds, we are not adopting any new restrictions on communications. As discussed above, the amendments to Securities Act rules 134, 138, 156, 163, 163A, 164, 168, 169, and 433 will make available the use of certain types of communications that were previously not available to affected funds. <sup>525</sup> Except as otherwise discussed below, we believe that there are no significant reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements associated with these amendments. As such, except as otherwise discussed below, we believe that there are no attendant costs and administrative burdens for small affected funds associated with these amendments.

In addition, the communications rules themselves do not create any new restrictions for smaller affected funds. Instead, smaller affected funds now may be able to take advantage of new communications options not previously afforded to them. <sup>526</sup> We also note that rule 163, and the new amendments, apply only to WKSIs. Consequently, these amendments to rule <sup>163</sup> will notproduce any benefit, or create any burden, for small affected funds because they would not qualify as WKSIs, as discussed above. <sup>527</sup>

To the extent that an affected fund uses a free writing prospectus under the adopted rules, any affected fund—large or small—will incur the burden of the requirement to file a free writing prospectus, or retain a record of the free writing prospectus for three years if it was not filed with the Commission. <sup>528</sup> However, we believe that the burden here will be negligible. Affected funds currently use rule <sup>482</sup> of the Securities Act to engage in communications similar to those that will be permitted under the amendments to rule 433, and these funds are required to file their rule <sup>482</sup> communication with either the Commission or, alternatively, with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) . <sup>529</sup> The burden associated with the filing requirements that the amendments to rule <sup>433</sup> will entail will therefore not be meaningfully different than the burden associated with the filing requirement for rule 482 communications. Rule <sup>433</sup> also creates a recordkeeping requirement. We do not believe that this requirement will create any significant burden given that records of rule <sup>482</sup> communications must also be retained for a period that willgenerally exceed that required under rule 433. <sup>530</sup> In addition, the recordkeeping requirement will apply only to affected funds (both large and small) that elect to use rule 433, as adopted.

The final rule also will affect broker-dealers participating in a registered offering.

Specifically, the amended rules will affect: (1) broker-dealers’ publication and distribution of research reports on affected funds; and (2) broker-dealers’ use of free writing prospectuses on affected funds.

The amendments to rule <sup>138</sup> will affect both large and small broker-dealers. These amendments will now permit broker-dealers to publish or distribute research reports with respect to a broader class of issuers and securities without this publication or distribution being an offer that otherwise could be a non-conforming prospectus in violation of section <sup>5</sup> of the Securities Act. <sup>531</sup> Broker-dealers that once used rule <sup>482</sup> ads styled as research reports, and instead rely on rule 138, as adopted, to publish or distribute similar communications, will no longer be subject to any filing requirement for these communications. Consequently, we expect that the amendments to rule <sup>138</sup> will result in fewer rule <sup>482</sup> communications being filed with FINRA . <sup>532</sup> This in turn will reduce filing-related administrative costs for broker-dealers publishing or distributingresearch reports on affected funds under the amendments to rule 138. However, large and smaller broker-dealers will not be affected differently by the amendments to rule 138.

In addition, the free writing prospectus rule amendments will permit broker-dealers to engage in these communications on behalf of the affected fund issuer. <sup>533</sup> This will require broker-dealers, both large and small, to file the free writing prospectuses that they use with the Commission, or maintain records of any free writing prospectuses used if it was not filed with the Commission. <sup>534</sup> However, certain of these broker-dealers are already required to file communications made under rule 482. <sup>535</sup> Broker-dealers that once used rule <sup>482</sup> ads and instead now choose to rely on adopted amended rule <sup>433</sup> to publish or distribute similarcommunications, will no longer be required to file these communications with FINRA. Consequently, the amendments to rule 433 could result in fewer rule <sup>482</sup> communications being filed with FINRA and a potential increase in filings of free writing prospectuses by affected funds with the Commission. <sup>536</sup> However, those broker-dealers that have not previously used rule <sup>482</sup> to publish or distribute the types of communications that the amendments to rule 433 permit, will newly be subject to both the filing and recordkeeping requirements of rule 433.

<h>3. New Registration Fee Payment Method for Interval Funds</h>

Interval funds, like other affected funds, are not currently permitted to pay registrationfees on this same annual “net” basis as mutual funds and ETFs, and pay the registration fee at the time of filing the registration statement. <sup>537</sup> As discussed above, we believe that interval fundswill benefit from the ability to pay their registration fees in the same manner as mutual funds and ETFs, and that this approach is appropriate in light of interval funds’ operations. <sup>538</sup> In addition,in response to comments to the Proposing Release, we also are adopting amendments to enable ETPs to register an indeterminate number of securities and to pay registration fees in arrears on an annual net basis. <sup>539</sup> As we discussed above, ETPs operate in a manner substantially similar to that of ETFs, and as commenters noted, share similar attributes with interval funds, which we highlighted in extending to interval funds the ability to pay registration fees on an annual net basis, including routine repurchases of shares at NAV and avoiding the possibility of inadvertently selling more shares than it had registered. <sup>540</sup> As a result, the final rule will require interval funds and allow ETPs to pay securities registration fees using the same method that mutual funds and ETFs use. <sup>541</sup> We believe this will benefit small interval funds and ETPs as well as larger interval funds and ETPs equally, and will make the registration fee payment process for all interval funds and ETPs more efficient as discussed above. <sup>542</sup>

<h>4. Disclosure and Reporting Requirements</h>

We also are adopting amendments, substantially as proposed, to our rules and forms that are intended to tailor the disclosure and regulatory framework for affected funds in light of our amendments to the offering rules applicable to them. <sup>543</sup> These amendments include: structured data requirements; new periodic requirements; amendments to provide affected funds additional flexibility to incorporate information by reference; and enhancements to the disclosures that registered CEFs make to investors when the funds are not updating their registrationstatements. <sup>544</sup>

Structured Data Requirements

The amendments will require BDCs, like operating companies, to submit financial statement information using Inline XBRL format; to require that affected funds include structured cover page information in their registration statements on Form N-2 using Inline XBRL format; to require that certain information required in an affected fund’s prospectus be tagged using Inline XBRL format; <sup>545</sup> and to require that filings on Form 24F-2 be submitted in XML format. <sup>546</sup> Large and small affected funds will both incur on a proportional basis, the costs associated with these adopted structured data requirements. Furthermore, as noted above, basedon our experience implementing the XBRL format, we recognize that some registrants affected by the adopted requirement, particularly filers with no Inline XBRL experience, likely will incur initial costs to acquire the necessary expertise and/or software as well as ongoing costs of tagging required information in Inline XBRL, and the incremental effect of any fixed costs, including ongoing fixed costs, of complying with the Inline XBRL requirement may be greater for smaller filers. <sup>547</sup> However, we believe that smaller affected funds in particular may benefit more from enhanced exposure to investors that could result from these adopted requirements. <sup>548</sup>

If reporting the disclosures in a structured format increases the availability of, or reduces the cost of collecting and analyzing, key information about affected funds, smaller affected funds may benefit from improved coverage by third-party information providers and data aggregators.

Periodic Reporting Requirements

The final rule also will require registered CEFs to provide the MDFP in their annual reports to shareholders, BDCs to provide financial highlights in their registration statements and annual reports, and affected funds filing a short-form registration statement on Form N-2 todisclose material unresolved staff comments. <sup>549</sup> These requirements are intended to modernize and harmonize our periodic reporting disclosure requirements for affected funds with those applicable to operating companies and mutual funds and ETFs.

The final rule requirement for registered CEFs to include an MDFP section in the annual report and for BDCs to provide financial highlights in their registration statement and annualreports will apply to all applicable affected funds, large and small. We do not believe it would be appropriate to treat large and small entities differently for purposes of the MDFP requirement because such disclosures helps investors assess fund performance over the prior year and complements other information in the report, which may make the annual report disclosure more understandable as a whole. <sup>550</sup> Such investor protection benefits are equally significant to investors in smaller affected funds as well as larger affected funds. <sup>551</sup>

For similar reasons, we believe that the informationa l benefit of BDCs’ inclusion of the financial highlights in their registration statements should apply equally to investors in large and small BDCs. We also believe the costs associated with this adopted requirement should be minimal for both large and small BDCs, since we understand that it is general market practice for BDCs to include this information in their registration statements. <sup>552</sup>

Finally, the final rule will require affected funds that file a short-form registration statement on Form N-2 to disclose material unresolved staff comments. Such a requirement will apply only to those entities that qualify for the short-form registration statement, which generally would not include smaller affected funds. <sup>553</sup>

Online Availability of Information Incorporated by Reference

The final rule will modernize Form N-2’s requirements for backward incorporation by reference by all affected funds. Affected funds will no longer be required to deliver to newinvestors information that they have incorporated by reference. <sup>554</sup> Instead, we are adopting new requirements that these funds make the incorporated materials and corresponding prospectus and SAI readily available and accessible on a website maintained by or for the fund and identified in the fund’s prospectus or SAI. <sup>555</sup> We do not believe this requirement will generate significant compliance costs for affected funds because many funds currently post their annual and semi- annual reports and other fund information on their websites. <sup>556</sup> Nor do we think it would be appropriate to treat large and small entities differently for these purposes. The adopted requirement will make the incorporated information, prospectus, and SAI more accessible to retail investors, who we believe may be more inclined to look at a fund’s website for information than to search the EDGAR system. <sup>557</sup> The final rule also will increase the likelihood that fund investors view the information in their preferred format, and thereby increase their use of the information to make investment decisions. <sup>558</sup> We believe that these investor protection benefits should be available equally for investors in smaller and larger affected funds.

Enhancements to Certain Registered CEFs’ Annual Report Disclosure

Finally, the amendments to rule 8b-16(b) under the Investment Company Act will require a fund relying on that rule to describe in its annual report the fund’s current investment objectives, policies, and principal risks. <sup>559</sup> The amendments also will require a fund to describein its annual report certain key changes that occurred during the relevant year in enough detail to allow investors to understand each change and how it may affect the fund, and to preface such disclosures with a legend. <sup>560</sup> The amendments to rule 8b-16(b) will only affect that portion of registered CEFs that rely on the rule . <sup>561</sup> We do not think it would be appropriate to treat large and small entities differently for purposes of the amendments to rule 8b-16(b), as this new requirement will allow investors in funds relying on the rule to more easily identify and understand key information about their investments. <sup>562</sup> We believe that this investor protection benefit should be available equally for investors in smaller and larger affected funds. In addition, the adopted new requirement will likely add only a small incremental compliance burden because funds relying on rule 8b-16(b) are already required to disclose the enumeratedchanges. <sup>563</sup> The amendments described in section II.I above will apply to affected funds that are small entities as well as other affected funds unless noted otherwise. <sup>564</sup>

<h>5. Automatic or Immediate Effectiveness for Filings by Affected Funds Conducting Certain Continuous Offerings</h>

As we discussed above, the amendments we are adopting to rule 486 will permit any registered CEF or BDC that conducts continuous offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(ix), includingunlisted continuously-offered affected funds such as tender offer funds, to rely on rule 486. <sup>565</sup> Our amendment to rule <sup>486</sup> will allow such funds to file post-effective amendments and registration statements that become effective immediately upon filing or automatically effective <sup>60</sup> days after filing, depending on the substance of the disclosure changes. <sup>566</sup> In doing so, we believe that such funds will be able to more efficiently update their financial statements under section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act to maintain effective registration statements while they engage in continuous offerings. <sup>567</sup>

These amendments will benefit both large and small continuously-offered unlisted affected funds, and we believe that they provide benefits similar to the benefits the adopted rule offers affected funds that will file short-form registration statements or qualify as WKSIs. <sup>568</sup>

Because the amended rule applies only to those affected funds that conduct continuous offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(ix), we expect this subset of affected funds to be limited. <sup>569</sup> In addition, although reliance on rule <sup>486</sup> is voluntary for continuously-offered affected funds who are newly permitted to rely on the rule, we expect many will rely on it due to the cost efficiencies sustained from a regime providing immediate or automatic effectiveness for post-effective amendmentsand certain registration statements. Notwithstanding this increased use, and because it will provide greater efficiencies, we do not believe the final rule will create any new meaningful reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance costs in relation to how affected funds currentlyfile post-effective amendments or registration statements. In addition, immediate or automatic effectiveness would permit smaller funds the ability to engage in offerings that meet investor demand, on a timely basis, for such offerings.

<h>E. Agency Action to Minimize Effe ct on Small Entitie s</h>

The RFA directs the Commission to consider significant alternatives that would accomplish our stated objective, while minimizing any significant economic impact on small entities. Although the BDC Act and Registered CEF Act required certain amendments to our rules and forms, we could have, for example, made additional modifications to the relevant provisions with respect to affected funds that are small entities. Alternatively, we also could have limited the scope to BDCs (as the BDC Act specified) and to interval funds and listed registered CEFs (as the Registered CEF Act specified), which would have excluded from the scope of the adopted rules certain small entities that are registered CEFs but that are not interval funds or listed registered CEFs. <sup>570</sup> Where our final rules reflect an exercise of discretion, we considered the following alternatives for small entities in relation to our amendments:

Exempting affected funds that are small entities from the adopted disclosure, reporting, or recordkeeping requirements, to account for resources available to small entities;

Establishing different compliance or reporting requirements or frequency to account for resources available to small entities;

Clarifying, consolidating, or simplifying the compliance requirements under the amendments for small entities; and

Using performance rather than design standards.

<h>1. Alternatives to the Adopted Approach to Implementing Statutory Mandates</h>

In accordance with the BDC Act and Registered CEF Act, to the final rule modifies the restrictions regarding offerings and communications permitted around the time of a Securities Act registered offering. The flexibility provided by our amendments will be greatest for larger and seasoned affected funds, but will also provide greater flexibility to all affected funds and broker-dealers, including small entities.

We considered modifying the public float standards in the WKSI definition or the short- form registration instruction by reducing the required level of public float or providingalternative eligibility criteria, such as an aggregate NAV of a certain size for funds whose shares are not traded on an exchange or through the use of “performance” rather than “design” standards. <sup>571</sup> These alternatives would have allowed more affected funds, potentially including small entities, to qualify as WKSIs or file short-form registration statements. However, we believe that modifying the eligibility criteria in the WKSI definition or the short-form registration instruction could weaken the investor protection benefits provided by those criteria.

We also considered extending the adopted rule amendments only to BDCs, listedregistered CEFs, and interval funds. <sup>572</sup> However, excluding unlisted registered CEFs from the adopted rule amendments will create unnecessary competitive disparities between unlisted registered CEFs (which will potentially include smaller funds) and unlisted BDCs and will notprovide investors in unlisted registered CEFs with the benefits of the new investor protections we are adopting. <sup>573</sup>

<h>2. Alternative Approaches to Discretionary Choices</h>

New Registration Fee Payment Method for Interval Funds

We considered, but are not adopting, provisions allowing a wider range of affected funds, such as registered CEFs that are tender offer funds, to rely on rule 24f-2. <sup>574</sup> To the extent that this alternative would have brought in additional small affected funds, it could have extended the benefits of this fee payment method to additional small entities. However, we did not adopt thisalternative approach because interval funds and ETPs have structural similarities to mutual funds and ETFs that other affected funds do not. <sup>575</sup>

Structured Data Requirements

As an alternative, we could have adopted amendments requiring the Inline XBRL requirements only for a subset of affected funds—for example, affected funds that file short-form registration statements on Form N-2 or WKSIs. <sup>576</sup> This would have lessened the burdenassociated with the structured data requirements on smaller affected funds. However, a structured data program that captures only a subset of affected funds would reduce potential data quality benefits compared to mandatory Inline XBRL requirements for all affected funds. <sup>577</sup> This in turn would reduce data users’ ability to meaningfully analyze, aggregate, and compare data.

However, we are adopting an extended compliance period for the new XBRL reporting requirements we adopted for affected funds that are not eligible to file a short-form registration statement. This extended compliance period—which will apply to affected funds that do not meet the transaction requirement to qualify to file a short-form registration statement on Form N- 2 ( i.e. , generally those affected funds with a public float of $75 million), and which encompasses the small entities subject to the adopted rule amendments discussed above—should enable small entities to defer the burden of additional cost associated with the adopted XBRL requirements and learn from affected funds that comply earlier.

Periodic Reporting Requirements and Online Availability of Information Incorporated by

Reference

We also considered a partial or complete exemption from the adopted periodic reporting requirements, and for the adopted requirements to make information incorporated by reference available on a website, for small entities. <sup>578</sup> With respect to the periodic reporting requirements, small entities that are not affected funds currently follow the same requirements that large entities do when filing periodic reports, and we believe that establishing different reporting requirements or frequency for small entities that are affected funds would not be consistent with the Commission’s goal of investor protection and industry oversight. For example, we couldhave adopted amendments to require smaller affected funds to include in their annual reports less information from their registration statements. While requiring less information would reduce costs to smaller affected funds by reducing the amount of required annual report disclosure, it could also make it more difficult for investors in these funds to find important fund information.

Similarly, we believe that the investor protection benefits associated with the other adopted periodic reporting requirements that apply to large and small affected funds—for example, the MDFP requirement for registered CEFs and the inclusion of BDCs’ financial highlights in their registration statement—should apply equally to investors in large and small affected funds. <sup>579</sup> We also believe that the investor protection benefits stemming from the adopted requirement to make materials incorporated by reference available on a website should be available equally for investors in smaller and larger affected funds, and therefore this adopted rule applies equally to large and small affected funds. <sup>580</sup>

<h>VI. OTHER MATTERS</h>

Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act, <sup>581</sup> the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has designated this rule a “major rule,” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2). If any of the provisions of these rules, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.

4 BDCs are a category of closed-end investment companies that do not register under the Investment Company Act, but rather elect to be subject to the provisions of sections 55 through 65 of the Investment Company Act. See section 2(a)(48) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(48)]. Congress established BDCs for the purpose of making capital more readily available to small, developing and financially troubled companies that do not have ready access to the public capital markets or other forms of conventional financing. See H.R. Rep. No. 1341, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 21 (1980). See infra section II.A for additional discussion of the definition of “affected funds.”

In this release we generally use the term “operating company” to refer to issuers that are not investment companies and that are currently eligible to rely on the rules we are amending.

This section also directs us to make specified revisions to allow a BDC to use the proxy rules that are available to such other issuers. Id. Affected funds generally use the proxy rules that are available to operating companies already. One current difference applicable to these entities, however, is a more limited ability to incorporate information into their proxy statements by reference. The BDC Act directs that we eliminate this difference by providing these entities parity with operating companies. Section 803(b)(2)(N) of the BDC Act; see also infra section .

28 In this release we use the term “seasoned” to refer generally to an issuer that meets the registrant requirements in General Instruction I.A of Form S-3 and, when referring to seasoned funds, a fund that meets these Form S-3 registrant requirements as well as certain modifications for registered CEFs. See Proposing Release, supra footnote , at

29 Issuers that rely on rule 415(a)(1)(x) must file a new registration statement every three years, with unsold securities and fees paid thereon carried forward to the new registration statement. See Securities Act rule 415(a)(5) and (6). If the new registration statement is an automatic shelf registration statement filed by a WKSI, it will be effective immediately upon filing.

30 See Proposing Release, supra footnote , at n.20.

31 The base prospectus of a shelf registration statement will generally describe in broad terms the types of securities and offerings that the issuer may conduct at some later time.

32 See Proposing Release, supra footnote , at n.22 (discussing “backward incorporation”).

33 The fund’s registration statement must include all required information to avoid liability from selling securities from an out-of-date prospectus and to satisfy section 10(a) of the Securities Act. See infra footnotes and accompanying text.

34 See Proposing Release, supra footnote , at n.24.

35 These post-effective amendments become effective pursuant to section 8(c) of the Securities Act on such date as the Commission may determine and are typically declared effective by the staff acting pursuant to delegated authority. In contrast, Form S-3 is updated through the filing of an annual report on Form 10-K, which contains the issuer’s audited financial statements for its most recently completed fiscal year. See Securities Offering Reform Adopting Release, supra footnote , at n.61; see also Proposing Release, supra footnote , at n.25.

36 See id. at n.26.

37 The final rule will give certain affected funds greater flexibility to control the timing of their capital raising. As discussed in the Proposing Release, section 23(b) of the Investment Company Act generally prohibits a registered CEF from issuing its shares at a price below the fund’s current net asset value (“NAV”) without shareholder approval (this provision applies to BDCs as well with certain modifications). See id. at n.27. Because the shares of affected funds often trade at a discount to NAV, by allowing certain affected funds to sell securities “off the shelf,” the final rule will avoid potential delays associated with updating the funds’ registration statements if they seek to access the markets when their shares are trading at a premium.

38 See, e.g., ACC Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; Comment Letter of Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (June 5, 2019) (“SIFMA Comment Letter”).

39 See ICI Comment Letter.

40 Throughout this release, we refer to General Instruction A.2 as the “short-form registration instruction” and refer to funds relying on this instruction as filing a “short- form registration statement” on amended Form N-2. Some of the required amendments and the conditions in our current rules are available only to issuers that meet the eligibility and transaction requirements of Form S-3 and therefore are eligible to file a short-form registration statement on that form. The short-form registration instruction in Form N-2 is designed to facilitate these amendments, as directed in the BDC Act and the Registered CEF Act.

41 See amended rule 415(a)(1)(x) (conforming amendments for affected funds); see also supra section .

42 See General Instruction I.B of Form S-3 (identifying transactions that can be registered on the form); see also General Instruction A.2.c of amended Form N-2. Form S-3, and therefore the short-form registration instruction, also is available to a majority-owned subsidiary that is a closed-end management investment company eligible to register a securities offering on Form N-2 if it meets certain conditions. See Proposing Release, supra footnote , at n.29 (describing the conditions necessary for majority-owned subsidiaries of closed-end management companies to register a securities offering on Form N-2).

43 See General Instructions A.2.a and A.2.c of amended Form N-2; General Instructions I.A (registrant requirements) and I.B (transaction requirements) of Form S-3.

44 Under this amendment to Form N-2, the fund also must have timely filed all reports required to be filed under section 30 of the Investment Company Act during any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement. See new General Instruction A.2.b of amended Form N-2.

45 See General Instruction I.A.3 of Form S-3.

46 See General Instruction I.B of Form S-3.

49 See infra section II.C.2 (discussing comments on public float requirement for WKSI eligibility).

50 Only one interval fund is currently exchange-listed.

51 We intend for the short-form registration instruction to provide affected funds parity with operating companies so that affected funds can register the same transactions as operating companies register on Form S-3. To register a primary offering of equity securities on Form S-3, an issuer must meet the applicable eligibility and registrant requirements. For example, an issuer with the requisite public float may register a primary offering of securities to be offered for cash. See General Instruction I.B.1 of Form S-3. Alternatively, an issuer may register a primary offering if it has common equity securities listed on an exchange, limits the amount sold over a twelve-month period to no more than one-third of the aggregate value of voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates, and meets certain other requirements. See General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3. Interval funds that are not exchange-listed and without public float would not be qualified to register a primary offering of their shares on Form S-3.

59 See new General Instruction F.3.a.(1)–(2) of amended Form N-2; cf. Item 12(a)(1)–(2) of Form S-3. In addition, if sales of a class of capital stock are to be registered on Form N-2 and the same class is registered under section 12 of the Exchange Act, the affected fund must incorporate by reference the description of the class contained in the Exchange Act registration statement with respect to that class (including any amendment or reports filed for the purpose of updating such description). See new General Instruction F.3.a.(3) of amended Form N-2; cf. Item 12(a)(3) of Form S-3.

60 See new General Instruction F.3.b of amended Form N-2; cf. Item 12(b) of Form S-3.

61 See new General Instruction F.3 of amended Form N-2. The amendments will permit a fund to use this incorporated information to provide the disclosure required by Items 3– 12 and Items 16–24 of Form N-2. See new General Instruction F.3.c of amended Form N- 2; cf. Item 12(d) of Form S-3.

62 The BDC Act directed us to extend this parallel item in Form S-3 (Item 12) to BDCs that meet Form S-3’s requirements. See supra footnote ; Item 12(d) of Form S-3; see also section 509(a) of the Registered CEF Act.

63 See section 803(b)(2)(P) of the BDC Act (directing us to revise Item 34 of Form N-2 to require a BDC to provide undertakings “that are no more restrictive than the undertakings that are required of a registrant under [Item 512 of Regulation S-K],” which sets forth the undertakings an operating company must include in its registration statement for certain offerings).

64 Form N-2 currently requires an affected fund registering an offering under rule 415 to undertake to file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post- effective amendment to the registration statement under certain circumstances, including to provide any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act. See Item

65 See 17 CFR 229.512(a)(1)(iii)(B) (Item 512(a)(1)(iii)(B) of Regulation S-K).

66 Specifically, our amendments add a new provision to the relevant undertaking stating that the requirement to undertake to file a post-effective amendment does not apply if the registration statement is filed under the short-form registration instruction and the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment is contained in Exchange Act reports that are incorporated by reference into the fund’s registration statement or is contained in a form of prospectus that is part of the registration statement. See Item 34.3.a of amended Form N-2; cf. Item 512(a) of Regulation S-K.

67 Form N-14 currently permits a registered CEF—but not a BDC—to incorporate by reference certain information about the registrant and the company being acquired that is required by Items 5, 6 and 11–14 of Form N-14 from its prospectus, SAI, or Investment Company Act reports into the Form N-14 prospectus. See General Instruction G of current Form N-14.

68 See Dechert Comment Letter; IPA Comment Letter.

69 See General Instruction G of amended Form N-14. We also are eliminating the instruction’s reference to sub-paragraph (d) of Section 30, and will instead reference Section 30 (no sub-part specified). This change will have the effect of requiring a Form N-14 registrant that seeks to incorporate by reference to be current in filing all Section 30 reports, including reports filed on Forms N-PORT and N-CEN. Commenters also suggested that we further amend Form N-14 to provide that a seasoned affected fund that incorporates by reference information about the registrant into the prospectus need not

70 See Dechert Comment Letter; IPA Comment Letter.

71 See General Instruction G of amended Form N-14. The requirement to file with the registration statement the documents that contain the information that is incorporated by reference is no longer necessary given the availability of such documents on EDGAR. We are similarly eliminating the requirement to file with the registration statement each document from which information is incorporated by reference into the SAI.

72 As proposed, amended Form N-2 will become effective on August 1, 2020. The Commission also will need time to modify its systems to automatically reflect that automatic shelf registration statements are effective upon filing and process “pay-as-you- go” payments for affected funds that are WKSIs. See infra section . Until such modifications are complete, which is anticipated to be September 2020, affected funds should contact the staff of the Division of Investment Management’s Disclosure Review and Accounting Office if they are filing an automatic shelf registration statement.

73 See rule 415(a)(1)(x) (amended to include securities registered pursuant to General Instruction A.2 of Form N-2). See also section 803(b)(2)(J) of the BDC Act (directing us to revise rule 415(a)(1)(x) to provide that a BDC that would otherwise meet the eligibility requirements of Form S-3 can register its securities under that provision). Our amendments also add a reference to a Form N-2 registration statement filed pursuant to General Instruction A.2 to rule 415(a)(2) to make clear that affected funds registering offerings pursuant to rule 415(a)(1)(ix), like other issuers relying on that provision, will not be subject to the limitation that they register an amount of securities that the issuer reasonably expected would be offered or sold within two years from the date that the

74 See General Instruction B of amended Form N-2; section 803(c)(2) of the BDC Act (directing that we amend Form N-2 to include an instruction that is similar to the instruction regarding automatic shelf registration offerings by WKSIs on Form S-3 to provide that a BDC that is a WKSI may file automatic shelf offerings on Form N-2). This instruction will provide that an affected fund that is a WKSI may use the form as an automatic shelf registration statement only for the transactions that are described in, and consistent with the requirements of, General Instruction I.D of Form S-3. This provides parity with operating companies because General Instruction I.D of Form S-3 specifies the transactions and requirements for an automatic shelf registration statement filed on Form S-3. Consistent with General Instruction I.D of Form S-3, General Instruction B specifies that the form could not be used as an automatic shelf registration statement for securities offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(vii) or (viii).

75 See 17 CFR 230.430B(a) (Securities Act rule 430B(a)).

78 As proposed, we are making conforming amendments to Securities Act rule 462(f) and to the registration fee table in Form N-2 to enhance consistency with Form S-3 and to allow affected funds that file as WKSIs to use the pay-as-you-go registration fee process. See section for a discussion of applicable effective dates for pay-as-you-go registration fees.

Those comments are addressed in section below.

In establishing the WKSI category of issuers for operating companies, the Commission stated that issuers that meet the $700 million public float threshold or the alternative $1 billion registered offering of non-convertible securities threshold have a wide following by market participants, the media, and institutional investors.

The ABA Comment Letter further asserted that the proposed $700 million public float requirement would be burdensome for affected funds relative to operating companies because, unlike operating companies, affected funds have a relatively fixed asset base (and therefore a relatively fixed public float) that would be unlikely to increase over time to a level that would satisfy the public float requirement.

107 See, e.g., ABA Comment Letter (stating that the “operating limitations, oversight requirements and investor protection provisions” that apply to affected funds under the Investment Company Act “more than compensate for Affected Funds’ lower level of research analyst coverage relative to large operating companies”); ICI Comment Letter (stating that affected funds “are subject to important requirements under the Investment

113 As discussed above, the Registered CEF Act, as enacted, requires us to allow only interval funds and listed registered CEFs to use the securities offering rules available to operating companies See supra section . To provide parity of treatment for similarly situated affected funds, we are exercising our discretion to extend certain of these rules to unlisted registered CEFs that are not interval funds. We do not believe, however, that it

114 For example, both unlisted REITS and unlisted affected funds sell their shares through intermediaries and both types of entities’ financial disclosures have been made directly accessible to investors through advances in technology.

115 As discussed at infra section , affected funds represent approximately 5.1% of all registered investment companies by number of funds and approximately 2% by assets. In addition, as discussed at infra section , we believe that providing affected funds with specific WKSI-eligibility criteria would not provide affected funds parity with similarly- situated operating companies that do not have public float or do not meet the $700

In addition, the Commission, having due regard to the public interest and the protection of investors, may declare an amendment or registration statement effective under rule 486(a) on an earlier date.

136 We also are making a technical amendment to rule 486(b)(1)(iv) to provide a more accurate cross reference to Item 9.1.c of Form N-2. Moreover, we are amending Form N- 2 to recognize the broader scope of affected funds that may rely on rule 486. See General Instruction E.4 of amended Form N-2 and cover page of amended Form N-2.

137 See supra sections and . Although affected funds that file short-form registration statements or qualify as WKSIs will be able to use forward incorporation by reference and automatically effective filings to make a broader range of updates to their registration statements on an immediate basis than those specified in rule 486(b), the majority of post-effective amendments that affected funds currently file are solely for one or more purposes described in rule 486(b). Moreover, interval funds, and affected funds that make continuous offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(ix), will be able to make other, material amendments that are automatically effective 60 days after filing.

138 Rule 415(a)(1)(ix), (x), and (xi) are the provisions affected funds primarily use to conduct delayed or continuous offerings of their securities. Rule 415(a)(1)(ix) allows nontraded affected funds to engage in continuous offerings but does not allow delayed (or “shelf”) offerings. Rule 415(a)(1)(x) allows affected funds that are eligible to file short-form registration statements on Form N-2 to engage in delayed or continuous offerings. Rule 415(a)(1)(xi) allows interval funds to engage in delayed or continuous offerings.

139 For example, rule 415 limits the amount of securities that can be registered in a continuous offering under rule 415(a)(1)(ix) and generally requires an issuer relying on rule 415(a)(1)(ix) to file a new registration statement every three years. See rule 415(a)(2), (5), and (6).

140 See rule 486(b)(2) (requiring certain written representations that a post-effective amendment filed under rule 486(b) is filed solely for one or more of the permissible purposes covered by the provision); rule 486(e) (requiring a fund to have filed a post- effective amendment or registration statement relating to its common stock that became effective within two years prior to the filing made under rule 486(a) or (b)).

145 See rule 486(b)(1)(i) and (v).

146 Under these circumstances, a non-WKSI fund potentially could combine its ability to forward incorporate by reference and its ability to rely on rule 486(b) to achieve a WKSI- like status, with registration statements that would always be immediately effective upon filing. This could occur if, for example, a fund made material changes to its registration statement by forward incorporating information into its registration statement and then, to satisfy the requirement to file a new registration statement every three years, it filed a new registration statement under rule 486(b). In contrast, when an affected fund that may rely on rule 486 makes a material change to its registration statement, the relevant filing

194 Item 13 applies to proxy statements seeking security holder approval to authorize, issue, modify, or exchange securities as described in Items 11 or 12 of Schedule 14A.

195 The proposed definition in Note E of Schedule 14A of an affected fund that “meets the requirements of General Instruction A.2 of Form N-2” included certain conditions relating to the transaction requirements in General Instruction I.B or I.C of Form S-3, consistent with the conditions in the definition in Note E of an operating company that “meets the requirements of Form S-3.” We are adopting the definition in Note E as proposed to provide parity between affected funds and operating companies although, as discussed in the Proposing Release, we believe these conditions are less likely to be relevant to affected funds. See Proposing Release, supra footnote , at n.152.

196 Rule 100 of Regulation FD generally requires an issuer to make either simultaneous or prompt public disclosure of any material nonpublic information regarding the issuer or its securities that the issuer or a person acting on its behalf has selectively disclosed to certain parties. See 17 CFR 243.100 (requiring simultaneous public disclosure in the case of an intentional selective disclosure or prompt public disclosure in the case of a non- intentional selective disclosure).

197 See section 803(b)(2)(O) of the BDC Act; 17 CFR 243.103(a) (rule 103(a) of Regulation FD).

198 In general, issuers today—including interval funds—are required under the Securities Act to pay a registration fee to the Commission at the time of filing a registration statement. See sections 6(b)(1) (requiring applicants to pay a fee to the Commission at the time of filing a registration statement) and (c) (providing that a registration statement shall not be deemed to have taken place without payment of a registration fee) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77f(b)(1)]. This means that they pay registration fees at the time they register the offering of securities, regardless of when (or if) they sell them. WKSIs using automatic shelf registration statements have additional flexibility to pay filing fees at or prior to the time of a securities offering. See supra footnote ; see also Securities Offering Reform Adopting Release, supra footnote , at 44780. This arrangement is commonly known as “pay-as-you-go.” Id. As a result, these filers may defer payment until a future takedown of shares off a shelf registration statement. Affected funds that become WKSIs as a result of our final rule will also gain that flexibility, but other affected funds will not. See supra section .

199 The final rule applies to interval funds the same treatment provided by rule 24f-2 to open- end funds and UITs. See amended rule 23c-3(e) (providing that an interval fund would be deemed to have registered an indefinite amount of securities under section 24(f) upon the effective date of its registration statement); see also amended rule 24f-2 (providing for interval funds to pay their registration fees on the same annual net basis as mutual funds, other open-end funds, and UITs). See section 4(e) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78d- 4(e)]; section 28 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77z-3)].

200 See section 24(f)(2) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-24(f)(2)]. Specifically, mutual funds and ETFs currently are required to pay fees on a net basis, based upon the sales price for securities sold during the fiscal year and reduced based on the price of shares redeemed or repurchased that year.

209 USCF Comment Letter; SSGA Comment Letter; WGC Comment Letter.

210 We believe that the scope of this definition properly limits the availability of this treatment to offerings of securities that share substantially similar attributes with those issued by ETFs, such as being listed on a national securities exchange and routine purchases and redemptions of the securities in “creation units” at NAV. The reference to “ratable share” in the definition encompasses repurchases or redemptions of securities that occur at NAV on an in-kind basis or cash basis.

211 We are amending a number of Securities Act registration statement forms (Forms S-1, S-3, F-1 and F-3) to provide that an issuer may elect to register an indeterminate amount of exchange-traded vehicle securities on these registration statement forms.

212 Rule 424(i) also includes certain disclosure requirements modeled after Form 24F-2.

213 For example, regulatory parity could mitigate any competitive disparities between affected funds and other issuers. It also could help investors in affected funds by providing them investor protections that are currently provided to investors in similarly- situated issuers. See, e.g., infra discussion in paragraphs accompanying footnotes – .

314 See ABA Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; and Invesco Comment Letter.

322 In addition to the proposed amendments to Form 8-K, we also are not adopting the associated proposed amendments to 17 CFR 240.13a-11 and 240.15d-11 (Exchange Act rule 13a-11 and rule 15d-11) because the proposed amendments to those rules were only necessary to carry out the proposal to require registered CEFs to report on Form 8-K.

323 See Investor Experience Request for Comment, supra footnote . See also supra

324 Although registered CEFs are only required to file Form 8-K reports under Item 5.04 (Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant’s Employee Benefit Plans), as applicable, other Form 8-K reports they file on a voluntary basis will be “filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act” for purposes of the incorporation by reference instructions in Form N-2 that apply to funds that are eligible to file short-form registration statements. See General Instruction F.3 of amended Form N-2; Exchange Act rule 13a-11(b)(1) and rule 15d-11(b)(1). Information a registered CEF furnishes on a Form 8-K report will not be incorporated by reference into the fund’s registration statement under this instruction. This is consistent with the incorporation by reference regime for operating companies on Form S-3, where information voluntarily filed on Form 8-K (e.g., under Item 8.01 (Other Events)) is incorporated by reference into the company’s registration statement while furnished Form 8-K reports are not incorporated by reference.

354 See supra section I for summary of final rule.

355 The estimated number of BDCs includes BDCs that have not registered a securities offering on Form N-2. Certain of our amendments, such as the requirement to tag certain Form N-2 prospectus disclosure items in Inline XBRL, will only apply to affected funds that have filed a registration statement on Form N-2. As a result, our quantitative estimates of the costs and paperwork burdens of these amendments with respect to BDCs may be over-estimates in certain respects.

356 The data (as of June 30, 2019) on prices and shares outstanding, which are used to calculate the public float, is taken from the Center for Research of Securities Prices (“CRSP”) database. CRSP data on shares outstanding includes all publicly held shares.

357 The estimated number of registered CEFs includes registered CEFs that have not registered a securities offering under the Securities Act. Certain of our amendments, such as the structured data requirements, will apply somewhat differently to these registered CEFs and may impose fewer burdens on them. For example, a registration statement that is filed under only the Investment Company Act is not required to include financial highlights information under Item 4 of Form N-2, while registered CEFs that file a registration statement under the Securities Act must disclose financial highlights information and tag that information in Inline XBRL. See General Instructions G and H of amended Form N-2. Thus, our quantitative estimates of the costs and paperwork burdens of certain of the amendments with respect to registered CEFs may be over- estimates in certain respects.

358 The average of net assets of registered interval funds is $520 million.

359 This includes the listed interval fund, which had public float of approximately $73 million as of June 30, 2019. Data on prices and shares outstanding, which is used to calculate the public float, is taken from CRSP.

360 Data on registered offerings (initial public offerings, equity offerings by seasoned issuers, convertible debt offerings, and public debt offerings) for BDCs and listed registered CEFs is taken from Securities Data Corporation’s New Issues database (Thomson Financial). Data on Regulation D offerings was collected from all Form D filings (new filings and amendments) on EDGAR. Data on registered offerings for unlisted registered CEFs was collected from Form N-2 and Form N-CSR filings on EDGAR.

361 See supra section .

362 See supra section .

363 See supra section .

364 See supra section .

365 This estimate is based on recent Form N-2 filings of the 49 listed BDCs. BDCs generally do not rely on existing Form N-2 backward incorporation by reference provisions because the form requires affected funds to provide to new purchasers a copy of all previously-filed materials that the fund incorporated by reference into the prospectus and/or SAI.

376 See supra section .

377 See infra section . For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that the hour burden of preparing and filing a post-effective amendment is 125 hours. Reducing the number of post-effective amendments by 128 filings would decrease the aggregate annual burden of Form N-2 by 16,000 hours (125 hours x 128 post-effective amendments = 16,000 hours). We estimate that the monetized internal burden is $33,625 per post-effective amendment and the external burden is $11,114 per post-effective amendment. See infra section

378 This analysis assumes that a BDC would file a prospectus supplement for each Form 10- Q filing (3 filings per year), Form 10-K filing (1 filing per year), and Form 8-K filing (estimated to be 10 filings per year), for a total of 14 periodic and current reports per year.

399 But see infra Table 14 footnote 1 (discussing that only 10 WKSIs relied on rule 163 for the Commission’s 2017 fiscal year).

400 For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that, on average, affected funds that are eligible to be WKSIs (estimated as 100 funds) would file two free writing prospectuses under the proposed amendments to rule 163 each year. We estimate the total incremental burden would be approximately 0.125 hours and $150 for the service of outside professionals. See infra section . We monetize the internal burden of preparing and filing a free writing prospectus by multiplying the burden hours by an estimated wage rate of $400 per hour (0.125 x $400 = $50). The estimated wage figure is based on analysis in previous rulemakings. The total annual cost is calculated by adding the monetized internal burden ($50) to the cost of outside professionals ($150).

401 See supra section .

402 See supra section .

403 The Commission has estimated the cost per rule 173 notice to be $0.05 for operating companies. See Securities Offering Reform Adopting Release, supra footnote , at 44795. We assume the same cost will apply to rule 173 notices provided to affected fund investors.

404 For the purpose of the PRA, we estimate that there will be 43,546 notices per year per affected fund with an effective Securities Act registration statement (estimated as 382 affected funds). The annual cost of providing rule 173 notification is calculated as the number of affected funds (382) x the number of notices per year (43,546) x the cost per notice ($0.05). See infra section .

405 Certain of our discretionary amendments may also ameliorate these costs. See infra section (discussing the benefits and costs of the requirement to disclose material unresolved staff comments) and section (discussing the benefits and costs of the structured data requirements).

419 The estimates are based on data collected for interval funds that were active as of June 30, 2018. We used their Form N-2 filings and Form N-CSR filings to identify current registration fees, proceeds from shares issued, and cost of shares repurchased.

420 As discussed below, interval funds and other funds that file on Form 24F-2 will be required to file the form in a structured XML format under the amendments.

421 For PRA purposes, we estimate an annual burden per respondent of filing Form 24F-2 of two hours. See infra section . At an estimated wage rate of $70 per hour, the annual dollar cost for filing Form 24F-2 is $140 (2 hours x $70 per hour).

430 For registered CEFs, for the purposes of the PRA, we estimated the average annual compliance costs in the 3 years following the adoption of the rule to be 12,628 burden hours of in-house Inline XBRL preparation (686 burden hours for Form N-2 cover page information using Inline XBRL and 11,942 burden hours for certain prospectus disclosure items) and $1,023,345 in outside services ($0 for Form N-2 cover page information using Inline XBRL and $1,023,345 for certain prospectus disclosure items).

436 In contrast, the information provided in Form 24F-2 is less complex and is generally only used by fund issuers and Commission staff for purposes of calculating certain registered investment companies’ registration fees, so we have proposed to require Form 24F-2 information in a structured XML format rather than Inline XBRL.

Specifically, we are amending rule 601 of Regulation S-K, and rules 11 and 405 of Regulation S-T. The additional collection of information burden that will result from the amendments to rule 601 of Regulation S-K, rules 11 and 405 of Regulation S-T, and Forms N-2 and N-CSR to require structured data reporting for affected funds are included in our burden estimates for the “Investment Company Interactive Data” collection of information, and do not impose any separate burden aside from that described in our discussion of the burden estimates for this collection of information.

480 We recognize that the costs of retaining outside professionals may vary depending on the nature of the professional services but, for purposes of this PRA analysis for rule 30e-1 and Form 10-K, we estimate that such costs would be an average of $400 per hour. This estimate is based on consultations with several registrants, law firms, and persons who regularly assist registrants in preparing and filing reports with the Commission.

481 We estimate that 25% of the burden of preparing and filing a free writing prospectus pursuant to rule 163 or rule 433 is undertaken by the issuer internally and that 75% of the burden is undertaken by outside professionals retained by the issuer.

To avoid a PRA inventory reflecting duplicative burdens and for administrative convenience, we assign a one-hour burden to Regulation C.

488 While we believe that the number of such registration statements to register an indeterminate number of exchange-traded vehicle securities will be higher immediately following the effectiveness of these amendments, we estimate that the number of registration statements for such offerings after this initial period will average a total of approximately 10 registration statements each year.

503 These estimates, reflecting the net assets of registered CEFs and of BDCs, are based on staff review of Forms N-CEN and N-Q filed with the Commission as of June 2019 and are based on the definition of small entity under Investment Company Act rule 0-10. Such funds will not necessarily be able to meet the transaction requirement to qualify to file a short-form registration statement on Form N-2 (i.e., generally those affected funds with a public float of $75 million) or to be a WKSI (i.e., generally those affected funds with a public float of $700 million). See supra section and .

504 See 17 CFR 240.0-10(c)(1) (Exchange Act rule 0-10(c)(1)). Alternatively, if a broker-dealer is “not required to file such statements, a broker or dealer that had total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last business day of the preceding fiscal year (or in the time that it has been in business, if shorter).” See id.

505 See Exchange Act rule 0-10(c)(2).

506 This estimate is derived from an analysis of data for the period ending June 30, 2019 obtained from Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single (FOCUS) Reports that broker-dealers generally are required to file with the Commission and/or SROs pursuant to Exchange Act rule 17a-5.

509 Based on data as of February 2020 from Morningstar Direct and Form S-1 and Form S-3 registration statements filed with the Commission within the past three years. As discussed above, we do not anticipate that any issuers at this time will use Form F-1 to register offerings of an indeterminate number of exchange-traded vehicle securities and pay registration fees for these offerings on an annual net basis. See supra section . Consequently, our figures do not reflect F-1 filers as a “small business” or “small organization.”

510 See also supra section (discussing the skills necessary to perform the recordkeeping, reporting, and compliance requirements of the final rule, including those to be performed internally by a fund, and those to be performed externally by professionals). The PRA provides for the hours, costs, and skill level associated with preparing disclosures, filing forms, and retaining records in compliance with our adopted rules. These skills would apply for compliance with the adopted rules by all funds, large and small, and Commission staff further estimates that small funds will incur approximately the same initial and ongoing costs as large funds.

528 See amended rule 433(d) and (g). Paragraph (d) of the rule provides for the various conditions and exclusions applicable to the general requirement of 433(d)(1) that an issuer or offering participant file its free writing prospectus. Paragraph (g) requires that if a free writing prospectus is not filed pursuant to paragraph (d) or (f) of rule 433, issuers and offering participants must retain all free writing prospectuses that have been used, for three years following the initial bona fide offering of the securities in question.

529 See note to paragraph (h) of Securities Act rule 482. Rule 482 requires that advertisements used in reliance on rule 482 are required to be filed in accordance with the requirements of rule 497, unless they are filed with FINRA.

Securities Act rule 433(g) requires an issuer and offering participants to retain all free writing prospectuses that have been used, and that have not been filed pursuant to paragraphs (d) or (f) of the rule, for three years following the initial bona fide offering of the securities in question. However, for a broker or dealer utilizing a free writing prospectus, rule 433 defers to the recordkeeping requirements under 17 CFR 240.17a-4 (Exchange Act rule 17a-4) (requiring sales literature to be retained for not less than three years).

Paragraph (b)(1) states that for WKSIs and seasoned issuers, both an issuer or offering participant may use a free writing prospectus, while paragraph (b)(2) states that for non-reporting and unseasoned issuers, any person participating in the offer or sale of the issuer’s securities may use a free writing prospectus.
